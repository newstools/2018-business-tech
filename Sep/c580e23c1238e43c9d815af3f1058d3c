A number of MTN customers received an SMS this past week indicating that the day on which they receive data bundles and other value-added services would change. An SMS sent to a BusinessTech journalist indicated that these services would now be provisioned on the 11th of every month (previously on the 15th) in an ‘effort to improve customer service’. Speaking to BusinessTech, Jacqui O’Sullivan, executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN SA, said that the company has embarked on a project to reduce the number of billing days in a month – from the current 11 days to a targeted 5 days. “This project will firstly rationalise the customer (B2C) base to one of three targeted billing days and aims to complete by the end of November this year,” she said “Early 2019 the project will begin rationalisation of the Enterprise customer (B2B) base to one of two targeted billing days and aim to conclude by July 2018.” “By reducing the number of billing days in a month, MTN aims to significantly improve operational efficiencies in retail bill and through this change, it will improve its customer billing accuracy.” O’Sullivan added that customers’ debit order/payment due dates will not change as part of this new rationalisation process.
