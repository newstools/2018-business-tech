The Financial Times has published a ranking of the top 100 masters in management programmes for 2018, which continues to grow in popularity globally. The list includes programmes from 27 countries, mostly in Europe, with more than 30,000 enrolled students. Masters in management programmes have a core of general management education in common but otherwise they vary widely. The shortest programme is eight months and the longest 36 months long, and cohort sizes range from 28 to 1,274, the FT said. Programmes are taught either by business schools or universities and come with very different price tags: tuition fees at ranked schools range from zero – where there is full state funding – to approximately £40,000. Swiss school St Gallen’s MA in Strategy and International Management tops the ranking for the eighth consecutive year. HEC Paris remains in second place, a position it has held since 2014, and London Business moves up one place to a new high of third. In order to be a part of the rankings, an institution’s programme must be full-time, cohort-based and have a minimum of 30 graduates each year.
