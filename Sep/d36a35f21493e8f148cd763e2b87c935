Woolworths has launched in-app shopping through its integrated lifestyle app, which the group says now makes it the most comprehensive retail app in the country. “Mobile is a crucial part of our digital strategy,” said Liz Hillock, head of online at Woolworths. “More than 60% of the traffic to Woolworths.co.za comes from customers browsing on their mobile phones and over the last year alone we have seen 64% growth in mobile transactions. Our mobile phones enable us to interact with each other and with retailers directly. “This means our customers want to be connected on-the-go and our Woolies App is designed to create a shopping community that is connected, with easy access to products and information,” she said. In South Africa, online shopping is forecast to grow at 19%, with an estimated R18 billion in sales projected for local sites and the majority of that growth coming from clothing sales. Woolworths saw almost double this market growth in online sales at 34% increase, with four times the growth in fashion, beauty and home online sales (at 77% increase) for the last financial year, it said. The app also allows customers to view their WRewards loyalty status, view and manage their financial services products (credit cards, store cards, personal loans), manage shopping lists, view in-store stock of the product they want and, of course, shop. “Along with incredibly useful information at your fingertips, customers can also play with our new innovations, such as the ability to scan the barcode of products in your fridge or cupboard and add them to your online shopping cart,” said Hillock. “The check-out process has also been specifically designed for mobile which makes it super quick and easy.” Read: South Africans can now contact politicians via WhatsApp for better service delivery
