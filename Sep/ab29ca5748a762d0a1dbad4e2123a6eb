Toyota has unveiled several tweaks for its Land Cruiser 200, its popular large-SUV, which is already approaching a thousand unit sales thus far in 2018. The Cruiser combines a large 7-seater SUV configuration, with renowned off-road credentials, thanks to a robust V8 diesel engine. “For 2018, the pinnacle of the Land Cruiser family tree has received some subtle tweaks, staying true to the proven formula,” Toyota said. As before two grade options are offered; the utility-focused entry level model has been rebadged as GX-R (GX of old) – to align the naming convention with its luxurious VX-R sibling, it said. Both grades are powered by a 4.5-litre V8 turbodiesel engine with outputs of 195 kW @ 3400 rpm and 650 Nm @ 1600 – 2600 rpm. Notable changes to the VX-R model are mostly found at the front of the vehicle. A new front grille design features two prominent horizontal slats intersecting the large grille opening in an east-west fashion – replacing the previously utilised multi-slat design. A smoked treatment has been applied to the Bi-LED headlamps and LED fog lamps, for enhanced visual differentiation. The headlamps themselves include Auto High Beam functionality, super bright LED illumination and Daytime Running Lights (DRL). A new Brown interior trim colour has been made available, now affording VX-R buyers a selection of three interior palettes – Beige, Black and Brown. The VX-R model continues to boast an impressive standard specification list, which includes the following: Blind Spot Monitoring
