A Soweto businessman who responded harshly to US president Donald Trump’s tweet on land reform, could now be facing legal repercussions. According to a report by the Sunday Times, Freeman Bhengu is being investigated by police after allegedly sending a bomb threat to the US embassy in Pretoria. Sources told the paper that the call made by Bhengu’s cellphone was recorded and easily traced to his location in Pretoria – despite lasting less than two minutes. In the recording, the caller said: “If the US interferes in our affairs then we will bomb the embassy.” When the Sunday Times contacted Bhengu, he also admitted to making the threat. “I did make that bomb threat. Listen, this is about South Africa … one has to be courageous and be brave. The US is bullying us and one has to tell them,” he said. The embassy added that it had deliberately tightened security following Trump’s tweets in which he directed his secretary of state to ‘closely study’ South Africa’s land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large-scale killing of farmers. However, it would not comment on the call or any specific security issues as a matter of policy. Trump’s tweet was met with widespread anger from both everyday South Africans and government, taking issue with his statements. “South Africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past,” government said. It added that it plans to speed up the pace of land reform in a careful and inclusive manner that does not divide the nation. Read: Government responds to Trump’s land tweet as rand takes a knock
