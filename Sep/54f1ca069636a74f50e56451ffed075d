Minister of home affairs, Malusi Gigaba, has confirmed that his department’s information and communication technology system is synchronised with the South African Police Service’s systems for biometric identification. In a recent parliamentary Q&A session, Gigaba said that the SAPS have access to the National Identification System (HANIS) system via the interface between Integrated Justice System (IJS) and the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). “The DHA has developed a ‘DHA-IJS hub’ used by the SAPS for verification or identification of SAPS clients whose biometrics are stored on HANIS,” he said. “If the person of interest’s biometrics are stored in HANIS, the following fields are returned as requested”: Name;
Facial Image;
Contact Information;
Birth Date;
Birth Country Code;
Living Indicator;
Death Date;
Gender Code;
Marital Status Code;
Marital Type Code;
Marriage Date;
Person Identification;
Residential Address;
Postal Address. New ABIS system In May, Gigaba announced the launch of the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). The new identification system will be powered by a sustainable technology and will offer a single view of citizens across the life cycle and their status change at various stages. Home Affairs said that the ABIS will act as a fundamental baseline for the broader National Identification System (HANIS) and will consolidate South African and foreign nationals’ data into a single base. “The grand plan seeks to integrate HANIS and the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) into an automated system through ABIS with the capability to identify and verify people through fingerprints, facial recognition and IRIS technology,” it said. According to the department’s 2018/2019 annual performance plan, it expects the AFIS data migration into ABIS to be completed within the 2018/19 financial year, with iris and palm-print recognition capabilities beginning to come online by 2019/20.
