Construction on a new town west of Durban has been given the green light, with the first phase set to kick off in early 2019. The town, currently known as the Ntshongweni Urban Development, is one of a select few new developments cropping up around the greater Durban area, earmarked to unlock new economic potential in the region. The project is part of the Tongaat Hulett portfolio, and will be about 30km out from Durban, and 60 km from King Shaka International Airport.  According to the group, the overall development vision and framework plan of Ntshongweni is to integrate the development opportunities with what already exists in the area. Individual projects within Ntshongweni will be undertaken by independent developers who will be guided by a big picture vision for the area, the group said, which is anticipated to take approximately 15 to 20 years to complete. According to Tongaat Hulett’s latest Land Development Portfolio Report (May 2018) the project’s urban and retail core is expected to draw R12 billion in investment, and ultimately generate 132,000 full time equivalent construction jobs and 14,000 permanent jobs, and rates generation of R206 million per annum. The logistics and business sector is expected to draw total investment and building construction activities of R10 billion, with 70,000 construction jobs and 6,500 permanent jobs created – while the value and job creation around the residential hubs has not been specified. Over time, the project will see over 20,000 residential houses being built, with over 500,000 square metres of residential space – 85,000 square metres of which will be retail. The 2,000 hectare project will also keep the environment open, with 1,000 hectares ‘reserved’ for open space, and passive and active recreational use.  The first phase of development will focus on the retail and urban precinct, and will ultimately generate 19,000 construction jobs – though over the project’s 20 year construction period, Ntshongweni is expected to generate 400,000 temporary construction jobs, 35,000 permanent jobs, R700 million in annual rates for the eThekwini Municipality and R5.1 billion in annual tax revenue.
