Capitec has partnered with IMImobile, a cloud communications software and solutions provider, to deliver a centralised client communications hub for what it says will be a more personalised digital banking experience. IMImobile delivers marketing communications across SMS, email, app push notifications, telemarketing, and direct mail. Using IMImobile’s integrated campaign management solution, Capitec can create, manage and deploy interactive mobile-first client communications. The UK based firm will provide critical communications to Capitec’s clients when opening new accounts, share digital bank statements and amend account details. Capitec will also employ the company’s enterprise-grade communications platform, to speed up the delivery of new banking services. IMIconnect’s visual workflow builder enables the design and launch of omnichannel customer journeys such as credit status checks, account and transaction notifications and surveys in a low-code environment, communicating easily between existing business systems and processes.
