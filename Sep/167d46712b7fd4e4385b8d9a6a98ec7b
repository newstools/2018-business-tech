Huawei has announced official pricing for its Mate 20 lite in South Africa. The Mate 20 lite’s stand-out feature is a massive 24+2 megapixel selfie camera packed with AI features to enhance every photo you capture. It also offers a larger display than its predecessors with a 6.3-inch FullView notched screen, with a Full HD+ resolution and 19.5:9 aspect ratio. Huawei said that Mate 20 lite users will also receive extended usage with its 3750mAh battery that rivals most smartphones available on the South African market. The phone will be available from 5 October at a Recommended Retail Price (RRP) of R8,999.  The competition While the  Huawei Mate 20 lite offers terrific value for money, there are a number of great smartphones on the market at a similar price point. As such it will likely face steep competition in a market where South African’s now expect flagship features as a given with their new phone purchases. BusinessTech looked at five of these competitors below. Lenovo Moto Z – R9,999  LG G6 32GB – R8,999  Xiaomi Mi8 128GB – R8,999  Sony Xperia XZ1 64GB LTE – R8,599  Samsung Galaxy A8 32GB – R7,099  Read: Here are the official iPhone Xs and Xs Max prices for South Africa
