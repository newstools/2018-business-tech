Only one in three South African vehicle owners take great pride in their cars while the majority of us would describe our vehicles as ‘nothing special’. However, half of us agree that our cars do reflect our personality. This is according to a new survey published by Gumtree which asked over 20,000 South Africans what they think about their own cars, and what they think of cars in the context of the greater South African motoring market. The questions included a focus on what the respondents were looking for in their next car purchase as well as the general affordability of owning a car right now. Key findings from the survey: 44% describe their vehicle as ‘nothing special’ while 32% say it is either their ‘pride and joy’ or ‘a symbol of my achievement’. 49% agreed that their vehicle reflected their personality. The top four factors in buying a vehicle are fuel efficiency, reliability, safety and price. The main barrier to buying a vehicle is affordability – 78% of people who did not own a vehicle responded that they either could not afford one or were in the process of saving for one. South Africans who don’t own a car favoured VW and Toyota as the cars they would realistically choose to buy and BMW, Mercedes and Audi as the top brands they dream about buying. ‘Environmentally friendly’ was the most popular asset of a dream vehicle. 5% of people who don’t own a vehicle were either ‘too scared of driving’ or had ‘no interest in getting a license’. Only 5% of respondents were in any kind of lift club for school runs or work.  Read: The cost of owning a car in South Africa is at an all-time high
