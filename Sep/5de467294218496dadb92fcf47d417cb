The South African Police Service has released its crime stats for the 2017/18 period, revealing which areas in the country have recorded the most crime in the past year. Overall, reported crimes were down in 2018 (-4.4%) from the total recorded in 2017. Across 17 community recorded crimes, there were a total of 1.66 million serious crimes reported in the period. As part of the presented data, the SAPS also broke down the police stations which recorded the highest levels of crime, with Cape Town central coming in as the most crime-ridden region, with 15,422 reported crimes – down 3.3% from last year. This was followed by Joburg central with 12,221 reported crimes (down 6.3%), and Mitchell’s Plain with 11,382 reported crimes (down 11.7%). Across the 30 worst precincts, there was a drop in crime level in all areas except three: Dobsonville (Gauteng), Plessislaer (KZN) and Delft. Of the three areas where crime levels increased, Delft saw the biggest jump in reported crimes – up 19%. For the rest, four areas saw the biggest improvements in crime levels: Stellenbosch and Worcester (Western Cape), Mitchells Plain, and Pinetown (KZN), where crime levels dropped 12.7%, 11.8%, 11.7% and 11.6%, respectively. In South Africa, crimes need to be reported at the police station that is closest to where the crime took place, giving a fair indication of the crime levels in the general region the police station is found in. It should be noted, however, that station statistics may encompass more areas than where the station is located. For example, a station in a remote area may represent the reported crimes of several neighbourhoods and small towns surrounding it, as it is the only station available to service those areas. There are approximately 1,140 police stations in the country. These are the 30 most crime-ridden areas in South Africa, based on crimes reported to their station across the 17 community-reported categories.
