Webber Wentzel says it has launched Webber Wentzel Alert, an online tool designed to trigger a co-ordinated legal emergency response at the click of a button in the event of a search and seizure by the police and/or other regulatory authorities  – commonly known as a dawn raid. Webber Wentzel Alert enables organisations to notify a pre-identified group of key individuals within their businesses and their pre-selected legal team at the legal firm that a dawn raid is in progress. Apart from saving valuable time, it also provides easy online access to best practice guidance on their rights and obligations during the raid, enabling an informed, co-ordinated and internally aligned response, it said. “Dawn raids are an increasingly frequent reality in South Africa and this user-friendly application removes a lot of frustration and uncertainty from the process when the rapid mobilisation of the right leadership and expert teams is critical – often in very difficult circumstances,” said Christo Els, a senior partner at Webber Wentzel. “Our end-to-end approach recognises and addresses the increasingly complex regulatory compliance challenges that are faced by most large organisations,” he said. The alert feature is a web-based application and simply requires internet connectivity for users to trigger the alert and receive alert notifications. The tool is available 24/7. Different individuals can be set up to receive notifications for each location at which an organisation conducts operations and the alert will also identify which location triggered the alert.
