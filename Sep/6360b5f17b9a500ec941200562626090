JSE-listed private education group AdvTech has announced its acquisition of Monash South Africa, adding it to its growing portfolio of private tertiary institutions. Monash South Africa is a joint venture between Australia’s Monash University and Laureate Education Inc, the world’s largest private higher education network. Through the acquisition, AdvTech’s tertiary student complement will climb to more than 40,000 full-time and 30,000 distance students. According to AdvTech, Monash South Africa “offers a world-class education environment, with a strong track record for student employability, outstanding pass rates and qualification completion times, which perfectly complements AdvTech’s existing offering”. “The Independent Institute of Education, AdvTech’s higher education division, together with its existing brands Varsity College, Rosebank College, Vega and now Monash South Africa, positions the company well to further develop its reputation as South Africa’s leading private higher education provider,” it said. The Monash campus, located on Johannesburg’s West Rand, is one of the largest private higher education precincts in the country with a capacity for 6,500 students. It boasts extensive sports facilities, laboratories, and four student residences, creating a university-like environment for students drawn from across the continent. In addition to a state-of-the-art campus, Monash also brings to the AdvTech portfolio a comprehensive suite of premium programmes, an extensive executive education and training portfolio, as well as new, highly sought-after programmes such as engineering and public health. The transaction follows a number of other recent acquisitions by AdvTech in the tertiary education sector, including Capsicum Culinary Studio, The Private Hotel School and Oxbridge Academy.
