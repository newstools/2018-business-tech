As part of the tabling of the annual Gauteng Roads and Transport 2017/18 report on 4 September, MEC Ismail Vadi provided an update on the current Gautrain expansion plans. “The planned Gautrain II expansion will be a major catalyst for further economic growth, social development and job creation along its proposed corridors,” he said. “Together with the Bus Rapid Transit systems, it will spatially integrate the five development corridors in our province. Mutually beneficial partnerships between government and the private sector will continue to give traction to the building of new road and rail corridors in Gauteng. Such partnerships foster alignment and harmonisation of land use and transport.” In March 2017, Vadi confirmed that 19 new Gautrain stations are being planned – including a new link to Lanseria Airport, and Soweto. These stations would form part of a proposed new line that starts from Mamelodi – Irene – linking to the old network, and branching off from Sandton to Randburg, Cosmo City, the Cradle of Human Kind, and Lanseria. Other areas to be covered in the expansion of the Gautrain include Mamelodi, Boksburg, Randburg-Lanseria, Mogale City and Syferfontein as well as Roodepoort and Jabulani. The expansion will primarily be done on a public-private partnership basis, in phases that will take up to 20 years to complete. Prices in 2011 Since becoming operational in 2010, the Gautrain service has seen a number of ticket price changes. The first phase of the project, which launched in May 2010 only contained four stations – OR Tambo, Rhodesfield, Marlboro and Sandton. A second phase – completed in 2011 – subsequently connected Sandton to Park Station, and Midrand to Hatfield in Tshwane. Upon becoming fully operational in 2011, it cost R105 to travel one way to the OR Tambo International Airport from Sandton, R125 from Pretoria, and R115 from Johannesburg Park Station. These fees were substantially cheaper when buying a monthly or weekly ticket. A monthly ticket from Hatfield in Pretoria to Park Station in Johannesburg cost R39 per trip while a single trip on a weekly ticket between Park Station and Hatfield cost R43. Commuters could pay R10 a day to park at stations if they were using the Gautrain and R80 a day if they were not. The cost of the required contact-less card was R10. Prices in 2018 On 1 June 2018, Gautrain announced its updated ticket prices for the year – showing that the most expensive one-way ticket (from Pretoria to OR Tambo) has increased from R125 to R183 (over 46%). This includes a new minimum requirement of R27 on your Gautrain card to use the service, with MyBroadband recently reporting expires every five years – regardless of whether you are actively using it. Gautrain has also extended the validity of its weekly option to 10 days and the validity of its monthly product to 44 days.
