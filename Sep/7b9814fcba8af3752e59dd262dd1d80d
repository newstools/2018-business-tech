The new private security prescribed minimum wages will kick-in from 1 October 2018 the Department of Labour announced on Monday (17 September). The current prescribed minimum wages in the sector expired on 31 August 2018, however, this was delayed due to a pending collective agreement. Workers in the Private Security are demanding a minimum wage of R7,500 and are threatening a strike if their wish is not granted. According to the department, some of the matters raised by workers in the Private Sector were: continued payment of “pittance wages”, non-existence of Provident Fund benefits, the insourcing of security services and elimination of middleman, and the employment of illegal foreigners. The workers also called for amendments of conditions of employment, demanding an increase in leave days, an end to intimidation of workers wanting to join trade unions, adherence to health and safety issues, and a review of night shift allowance.
