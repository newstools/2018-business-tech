While new vehicle sales in August showed a decline of 2.5% year-on-year, the performance of the industry has remained relatively flat from a year-to-date perspective at -0.6% over the first eight months of 2018. This is according to the latest data  released by the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa), which noted that of the 47,964 total industry sales last month, 66% went to the passenger vehicle segment which is down 2.2% year-on-year. Light commercials, which contributed 29% of total sales, are down 5.8% year-on-year and 2.5% year-to-date. The commercial segment comprising buses, medium, heavy and extra-heavy vehicles made up the final 5%, and is up 16% year-on-year. “Despite perpetual pressure on the economy this year with total industry sales remaining subdued, the dealer channel has been resilient showing 2.4% year-to-date growth,” said Ghana Msibi, WesBank’s executive head for sales and marketing. “With four months remaining in 2018, WesBank’s forecast of 3% growth is still possible. However, if the deterioration of the rand to foreign currencies continues as we’ve seen in August, consumers could feel more of a pinch when buying new cars going forward,” he said. Below are the 10 bestselling cars for August 2018, according to Naamsa’s data.
