MTN says its customers will soon be able to experience clearer and crisper voice calls with the introduction of Voice over LTE (VoLTE) service. The service has gone live (13 September 2018) to selected smartphones and will be marketed as High Definition Voice (HD Voice). “Supporting our drive for technology excellence, the HD Voice service will allow customers to benefit from voice calls in clear, natural-sounding HD Voice on MTN’s LTE network, coupled with a faster call connection time,” it said in a statement on Thursday. In order to enable the HD voice service, customers are required to update their smartphones with the latest software made available by their smartphone manufacturer. Once they accept the software update, their smartphone will automatically be enabled with this service. MTN said that customers will benefit from a complementary 1GB data that can be used for the software update. Once completed, the device will be enabled and HD Voice calls will be billed according to normal price plan rates. The introduction of VoLTE will be carried out in a two phased approach – the first phase, starting in September, will onboard Samsung S8 & S8+, Huawei P20 Lite, Sony Xperia XZ2 and CAT S61 users to the service. The second phase to be rolled out from October onwards, will enable more smartphone users to access HD Voice service, MTN said. Read: The best mobile networks in SA: Vodacom vs MTN vs Cell C vs Telkom
