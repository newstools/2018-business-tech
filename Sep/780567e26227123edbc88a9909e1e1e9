The total number of jobs reported in the second quarter showed a decrease of 69,000 – bringing the total number of persons employed in the formal non-agricultural sector of South Africa to 9,748,000. This is according to new figures from the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) survey, released by Statistics South Africa on Wednesday (26 September). The biggest job losses were reported in the community services industry, with 67,000 jobs shed. “These jobs were mainly casual work and were observed in the extra-budgetary account sub-sector that employed staff due to next year’s national election registration drive,” Stats SA said. “The mining industry continued to shed jobs for the fourth consecutive quarter with 2,000 jobs lost in the second quarter of 2018, while the manufacturing industry lost 13,000 jobs. “There was a slight decrease in the transport industry, with 2,000 jobs shed. Moderate gains were reported in the trade and business services industry with the adding of 7,000 jobs each, followed by the construction industry with a slight increase of 1,000 jobs. The job level in the electricity industry remained unchanged in the reference quarter,” it said.  Despite the decline, Stats SA noted that year-on-year formal sector jobs rose by 13,000 in the second quarter of 2018 – compared with the same period of 2017. “There was a decrease of R5 billion in gross earnings from the previous quarter,” it added. “The total amount of gross earnings paid for the quarter was R627 billion. The decreases in earnings were led by the business services industry with R12 billion. This was followed by the mining industry with R699 million.” “Increases in earnings were reported by the community services industry with R3,5 billion. This increase was followed by the transport industry with R2,3 billion; construction industry with R1,1 billion; manufacturing industry with R570 million; trade industry with R307 million; and electricity industry with R94 million.” Average monthly earnings were measured at R20,176 in the formal non-agricultural sector of the economy in May 2018.
