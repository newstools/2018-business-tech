One of the single most important considerations when purchasing a car is resale value. True Price, a South African startup which provides motorists with free vehicle evaluations, recently compared a list of entry-level vehicles based on their original retail price and the prices they were later sold for on auction. According to Darryl Jacobson, managing director of True Price, the Toyota Aygo currently offers the best resale value. “It is achieving 75% of original list price on auction, making it the clear leader in resale values. This almost certainly is thanks to Toyota’s reputation for building reliable vehicles,” he said. Second place goes to the Kia Picanto which managed to maintain an average of 68% of its original list price on auction. “Kia is a brand that has grown in reputation and stature – both globally and here in South Africa. For instance, JD Power’s 2017 Initial Quality Study (IQS) recently recognised Kia Motors as the highest-ranking nameplate in the United States for the second year in a row. “Here in South Africa, Kia vehicles are also considered to be real quality acts,” Jacobson said. Third place was awarded to the Hyundai i10 which managed to retain 66% of its original list price. Jacobson added that these statistics should be extremely valuable to purchasers of entry-level vehicles. “Naturally, this is the most cost-sensitive segment of the market. It’s very important to factor in resale values when making a vehicle purchase – and these statistics will help motorists to make an educated decision when purchasing what could be their first car,” he said.
