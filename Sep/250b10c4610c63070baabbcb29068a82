Cabinet ministers will pay just R1,200 a month to live in lavishly renovated multi-million-rand apartments in Cape Town – labelled as a slap in the face for taxpayers. According to a report by the Sunday Times, the 29 flats recently underwent a R100 million, two year-long renovation – at an average cost of R3.6 million each. The flats will house ministers, their deputies and senior officials. The report noted that: Ministers who earn R200,000 a month will pay R1,200.82 to rent an apartment;
Deputy ministers earning R165,000 will be charged R988.90;
Directors-general will pay just R75. Speaking to the Sunday Times, property analyst Erwin Rode said the department had ‘overcapitalised’ on the renovations. “That’s a lot of money, unless you want to install gold-plated toilet seats and gold taps,” he said. “You don’t use that kind of money unless you are the Queen of England. Prima facie, it looks wasteful. The question is whether there is something behind the wasteful expenditure.” Two building industry experts echoed Rode’s sentiments, with government paying R9 million for windows – R310,000 per flat.
