Collectors coins in South Africa The South African Mint – which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the South African Reserve Bank – produces numismatic collectors’ coins covering a wide range of themes such as the Natura coin series and the Krugerrand series. These are sought after by both domestic and international collectors. The SA Mint also issues special edition commemorative coins in limited quantities. These are accessible to collectors who can afford to pay higher prices. Such limited edition collectors’ coins are usually packaged in capsules and are accompanied by the relevant certificates to prove their authenticity. The value of these coins is set by the collectors’ market and the SARB cannot and does not speculate on this value. “Interested consumers and collectors alike are encouraged to do their research and shop around to compare prices between dealers before deciding to invest in a coin. Familiarise yourselves with the differences between ‘normal’ circulation coins, commemorative circulation coins and collectors’ coins,” the SARB said. By comparison, commemorative circulation coins such as the celebratory Mandela R5 coin, are ‘normal’ circulation coins and are worth no more than their face value.
