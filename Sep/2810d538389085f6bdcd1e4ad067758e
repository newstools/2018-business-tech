Financial services company, Alexander Forbes, has announced the termination of its group chief executive and director of the company – Andrew Darfoor – with immediate effect. In a shareholder statement released on Tuesday morning (25 September), the company cited ‘a loss of confidence and trust’ as the reason for his termination. It added that its board would prioritise the search for a new group chief executive and that an appointment would be made ‘imminently’. In the time being, Ms M Ramplin, an independent non-executive director of the company would hold the position of interim group chief executive. Darfoor was appointed to the post in August 2016. Earlier this month, the company said that about 15% of votes at its annual general meeting had been cast against the election of Darfoor as a member of the group social, ethics and transformation committee.
