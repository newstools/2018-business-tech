Gumtree Auto recently announced its category shortlists for its 2018 Pre-Owned Car Awards. The inaugural awards were first held in 2017 and saw Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz mop up the categories with three and two awards respectively. This year’s winners will be announced on 8 October at a gala event in Johannesburg – with categories including everything from budget city cars for less than R130,000 to large luxury SUVs for over R600,000. The focus on pre-owned cars comes at a time where a weakening exchange rate and other pressure factors have meant that it is almost impossible to buy a new car for less than  R100,000 – and you can often expect to pay closer to the R200,000 mark for more established brands with enhanced safety features and added extras. According to Gumtree, twice as many South Africans still buy previously owned vehicles. “The data shows that 55% of all used vehicles sold are either demo models or are under two years old. That is now a very competitive space and sellers will have to consider lowering their prices,” said Jeff Osborne, head of automotive at Gumtree South Africa. This means that there is typically great value in South Africa’s pre-owned market. Below BusinessTech looked at the best pre-owned hatchbacks you can buy in South Africa for under R160,000 – according to Gumtree. Renault Sandero 900T Dynamique  Year: 2016
