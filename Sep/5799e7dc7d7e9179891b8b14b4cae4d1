KZN: Not enough information available In-demand job skills As has been the case for the past few months, South African employers are looking for three main sets of skills – software developers, middle/department managers and financial/project accountants. Software development remains a much-needed skill set on the South African job market. Over 24% of vacancies on CareerJunction are IT related, with most allocated to software developers. Middle/department managers also remain highly sought-after, particularly finance managers, who take up their share of over 40% of associated jobs. There is also a growing demand for professionals in financial/project accounting. Since January, demand for these professionals has strengthened by more than 25%. Despite the growing labour demand, the job market remains competitive, CareerJunction said.  “An overview of vacancy levels across various sectors (indicated by the above graph) provides a good indication of where the majority of employment takes place,” CareerJunction said. “The IT, business & management and finance sectors are undoubtedly the most sought-after sectors, followed by the sales, admin, office & support and architecture & engineering sectors, among others listed. “When looking at active job seekers across various sectors, areas of high supply correlate closely to areas of high demand, however, supply outstrips demand in some areas, leading to a competitive environment for job seekers. The opposite is seen for some industries.” R.ead: Joburg no longer South Africa’s financial centre in new ranking
