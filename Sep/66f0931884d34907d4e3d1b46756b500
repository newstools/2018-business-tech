A number of top ANC figures – including former president Jacob Zuma – are allegedly plotting in secret to unseat President Cyril Ramaphosa. According to a report by the Sunday Times, citing sources within the party, two clandestine meetings were said to be held in KZN last week with staunch backers of the plan. Those who allegedly attended the meetings include: Former president Jacob Zuma
ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule
Former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo
ANC Women’s League secretary-general Meokgo Matuba
ANC Youth League KwaZulu-Natal secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo
Former SAA board chair Dudu Myeni The group reportedly plan to challenge the outcome of last year’s ANC national conference, which elected Ramaphosa as party president. Their argument will be based on the fact that there were mass irregularities at branch meetings and that a large number of delegates were illegitimate. According to the Sunday Times, what particularly worries senior officials at Luthuli House is Magashule’s presence. As secretary-general, he is in charge of the ANC’s daily operations  – while apparently also being at the centre of plans to undermine the party’s president. Other senior ANC leaders, who asked not to be named, said party officials have long suspected Magashule’s involvement in plans to dislodge Ramaphosa, but never had proof to confront him with. When asked for comment, ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairperson Sihle Zikalala said that there was no formal meeting scheduled with Magashule or Zuma.
