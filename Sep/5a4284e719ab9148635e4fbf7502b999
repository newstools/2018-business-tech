BankservAfrica’s latest take-home pay index revealed that South African salaries increased by 2.2% year on year as at June 2018. However, inflation grew by 4.6% effectively resulting in a year on year salary decline 2.4%. When comparing the rate at which average salaries for white-collar workers have increased in the last decade, it can be determined that South Africans are in fact getting poorer, even though their salaries are technically increasing. This is according to Broll’s latest retail report which examined how the prices of key products and services have increased over the past 10 years as well as year-on-year in 2018, and the effect this has on the spending power of the average South African. “An exercise was undertaken whereby the average salaries for lawyers, administrative assistants, engineers, accountants, personal assistants and teachers from 2008 to 2018 were investigated,” Broll said. “It was found that real salaries rose at an average of 4.9% per annum over this period. However, when adjusted for inflation it turns out that salaries should have grown by 6.7% per annum for people to be earning the equivalent of what they did in 2008. “Thus when comparing 2018 real vs adjusted for-inflation salaries, people are in fact 10.6% poorer than they were in 2008,” it said.  Factors affecting consumer spend As part of the report, Broll looked at a number of which factors were to blame for the decline in consumer spending. It also offered a comparison of 12 everyday items, and how much they cost in 2008 vs 2018. These include: VAT hike – Consumer spending has been set back even further with the 1% increase in VAT effective 1 April, a 52 cents increase in the fuel levy and sin taxes up between 6% and 10% depending on the product, the report notes. Electricity – South Africa’s electricity cost is in the higher bracket compared with 95 countries across the globe with citizens paying R2.05/kWh compared to the world average of R1.51/kWh. The high cost of electricity hangs on Eskom’s supply shortages and thus prices have increased more than 350% in the past decade, a trend that is unlikely to reverse. Property – The annual increase in municipal rates, taxes and services costs, as well as the re-valuation of properties also increase the financial burden of consumers, it said. Petrol – The petrol price, although competitive on a global scale, saw a July increase that set a new record hitting R16.02/litre for 95 unleaded. When compared to prices in 2008, petrol now costs 49.7% more. This not only impacts the cost of transport but has spin-off costs in all related industries and particularly food, it said. Groceries – Broll added that the cost of basic goods such as milk, meat, sugar, bread and cheese was much cheaper 10 years ago with a basket of goods in 2018 costing 93.4 % more.  White bread costs R13.49 today, but cost only R5,89 in 2008. Sin taxes –  Cigarettes now also cost more than double at R45.35 (for a 20-pack) compared to R20.13 in 2008 while 250g of instant coffee now takes R36.99 out of your pocket, but only cost R13,80 in 2008. Entertainment – Going to the movies is quite an expensive outing, the report indicates, with the cost of a 2D movie ticket about R85, costing closer to R25, 10 years ago.
