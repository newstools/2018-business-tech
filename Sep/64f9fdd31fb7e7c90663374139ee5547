Ride-hailing company Taxify has boosted its focus on driver safety with drivers now able to connect quickly and easily to private security response teams, emergency medical services and roadside assistance in the event of any medical or security emergencies. The new safety feature comes about through an expansion of Taxify’s existing partnership with Namola in South Africa, it said. The initial partnership, announced in April 2018 and designed to alleviate some of the risks faced by Taxify drivers, saw the integration of an emergency SOS button into the Taxify driver app that shared drivers’ name, cellphone number, GPS coordinates, and vehicle details with Namola’s 24/7 Response Centre, when activated. The integration, which has been rolled out to all Taxify drivers in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth, has now been upgraded so that drivers can access rapid deployment of private security and emergency services. This is in addition to the initial capability of connecting with police, ambulance, and fire services. The new feature expands Taxify’s growing portfolio of driver safety initiatives, which include safety summits, monthly round table engagements with drivers, weekly safety updates, rider verification, awareness of safety hot-spots, and hijack prevention training. Through the feature, Namola’s Response Centre also advises drivers how to respond and behave until the authorities arrive, helping them stay calm and take positive steps to stay safe if they are in a threatening situation. Namola is a free mobile safety app, that was launched in 2017. The group also captures data about dangerous hotspots and is able to share it with the authorities as well as with Taxify’s high priority team. Read: Uber vs Taxify prices in South Africa
