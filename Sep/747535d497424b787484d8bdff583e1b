While new vehicle sales in August showed a decline of 2.5% year-on-year, many locals still splash out on some of the finest vehicles money can buy. According to the latest South African Wealth Report, luxury SUVs are especially popular with the country’s super-rich, primarily because of their: High road clearance (SUVs handle potholes and bad roads better than luxury sedans and sports cars);
Safety aspects;
Space for children; and
Usefulness for holidays – off road, game reserves etc. The report also noted that South Africa’s HNWIs have clear favourites when it comes to brands – with Porsche the most popular brand when it comes to revenue earned in South Africa, followed by Ferrari and Bentley.
