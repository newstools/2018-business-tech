Cryptocurrency exchange, Luno, announced the opening of a new regional headquarters in Johannesburg on Monday (17 September). While Luno has stated that it was the first crypto company to operate in Africa, its presence has been largely limited to Nigeria and South Africa – in addition to the 40 other markets it operates in across Europe and Southeast Asia. Luno CEO, Marcus Swanepoel said that his company has been closely monitoring the rest of the African market and believes that the time is now right for a dynamic expansion across other African markets. “The new team in Johannesburg will be working closely with our team in Lagos, Nigeria, to launch across a number of African markets over the coming months,” he said. “In addition to building out the Africa coverage team, the Johannesburg office will also be home to a brand new engineering team. We’re currently recruiting for over 30 roles in Johannesburg, with additional roles expected as the business expands into more African countries.” Swanepoel said that Luno was looking forward to working closely with governments, regulators and financial institutions to help create an environment that fosters innovation and job creation that will contribute to broad-scale growth, drive economic opportunities and ultimately, real value for consumers. “The long-term positive value that our industry and Luno can provide to people across the continent makes it an extremely exciting and rewarding endeavour. It’s a huge opportunity to really live out our vision of upgrading the world to a better financial system,” he said. Swanepoel added that Luno is looking for applicants to join a diverse team of incredibly smart, friendly, ambitious and interesting people. You can find the list of jobs on offer here.
