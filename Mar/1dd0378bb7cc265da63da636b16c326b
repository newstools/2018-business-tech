Australian home affairs minister Peter Dutton is considering fast-tracking visas for white South African farmers. The  minister told the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday that his department is examining a range of methods to fast-track their path to Australia on humanitarian or other visa programmes. According to a report by The Guardian, a number of Australian media outlets have raised concerns with the recent proposal of ‘land expropriation without compensation’, and reported that white farmers in the country are being murdered at a rate of more than one per week. “If you look at the footage and read the stories, you hear the accounts, it’s a horrific circumstance they face,” Dutton said. “The people we’re talking about want to work hard, they want to contribute to a country like Australia. “We want people who want to come here, abide by our laws, integrate into our society, work hard, not lead a life on welfare. And I think these people deserve special attention and we’re certainly applying that special attention now.” Dutton said that Australia has a number of refugee, humanitarian and other visa programmes which could possibly used to help these South Africans. He added that he had asked his department to look at the options “because from what I have seen they do need help from a civilised country like ours”.
