Following health minister Aaron Motsoaledi’s confirmation on Sunday of the source of the country’s listeria outbreak, Pick n Pay and other stores have announced that they will be removing a number of items from their shelves. In a statement issued by Pick n Pay on Sunday evening, the retailer said that both Enterprise and Rainbow (the two major companies implicated in the outbreak) supply a very broad range of retailers across South Africa and as a result will see most of their products recalled. “All Enterprise products (including the Bokkie, Renown, Lifestyle and Mieliekip brands) have already been recalled by the company concerned and we are urgently withdrawing them from our stores,” it said. “In addition, all ready-to-eat products such as polony and russian sausages manufactured at the Rainbow facility in Sasolburg are also being withdrawn.” The company said that as an added precaution, Pick n Pay branded chicken polony, manufactured by Rainbow, is also being withdrawn. “All fridges and food preparation areas in our stores will now be re-cleaned to prevent any cross-contamination. Recalled meat is being isolated and will be safely destroyed,” it said. Other stores Both Spar and Shoprite have confirmed that they are also in the process of removing all foods provided by Rainbow and Enterprise across their stores. “In the interests of our customers, we will be removing all Enterprise products and Rainbow Polony from our stores immediately. Customers are welcome to return these products to our stores for a full refund,” the Spar group said. Shoprite said it had also immediately started to remove the products produced by Enterprise and Rainbow products from its perishable departments and delicatessens, and that affected customers would be offered a full refund.
