International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu on Thursday issued a diplomatic démarche to the Australian High Commissioner to South Africa, Adam McCarthy. Governments use démarches to protest or object to actions by a foreign government. As such minister Sisulu has demanded a retraction of the comments made by Australia’s Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton on the South African land redistribution process. Media reports reported that Dutton said they are exploring how to bring white South African farmers to Australia on humanitarian grounds due to the land redistribution process and the violence on farms, which they say is racially charged. He was quoted as saying that South African farmers require “special attention” as they’re being persecuted. He added that white farmers should receive fast-tracked humanitarian visas from a “civilised country” like Australia. Ministerial spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya said: “It was communicated to the High Commissioner that the South African government is offended by the statements which have been attributed to the Australian Home Affairs Minister and a full retraction is expected”. The high commissioner, who was accompanied by his deputy, undertook to immediately communicate with their government to convey the message from the minister and South African government.
