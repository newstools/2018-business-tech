The winners of the World Car of the Year Awards have been announced at the New York Auto Show on Wednesday evening (29 March). The Volvo XC60 was announced as the overall winner from an initial entry list of 34 vehicles from all over the world – with the Mazda CX‐5, and Range Rover Velar named as runners-up. To be eligible for the overall World Car award, the candidates must have been available for sale on at least two continents from 1 January 2017 – 31 May 2018. This year, vehicles were selected and voted on by an international jury panel comprised of 82 top‐level automotive journalists from 24 countries. Each juror was appointed by the World Car Steering Committee on the basis of his or her expertise, experience, credibility, and influence.  Each juror typically drives and evaluates new vehicles on a regular basis as part of their professional work.
