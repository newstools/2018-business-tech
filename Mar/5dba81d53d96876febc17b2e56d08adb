Google has announced the introduction of 39 new languages to its maps platform – including Afrikaans and Zulu. Google said in a statement  that despite only offering English when it first launched 14 years ago, today more than a billion people use Google Maps to discover new places, find the best driving, biking, and walking routes. It said that it believes that Zulu and Afrikaans – along with the 37 other new languages – will help reach an additional 1.25 billion people worldwide. The new language options will be available in the Google Maps app on Android and iOS, as well as to desktop users. According to the latest census data (2011), Zulu is the most widely spoken language in the country with more than 11.6 million speakers. This is followed by Xhosa with over 8.15 million speakers, and Afrikaans, with more than 6.85 million speakers. English is some distance away with 4.9 million speakers.
