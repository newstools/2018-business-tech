T-Systems South Africa (TSSA) has appointed Dineo Molefe, who has been chief financial officer (CFO) of the company for two years, as the new managing director (MD) of the digitisation services provider. Current MD Gert Schoonbee will be handing over the reins to Dineo, effective 30 April 2018, after more than 18 years with T-Systems South Africa (TSSA), of which the last six have been as MD. Having qualified as Chartered Accountant (CA) SA, Molefe went on to complete a Masters in Commerce at the University of Johannesburg and the Advanced Management Programme at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business School. “I look forward to working with my colleagues at T-Systems, as well as with our clients, suppliers and partners as we continue shaping a new T-Systems in South Africa,” said Molefe. “I want us to become the leading provider of secure, cloud-based service in a world of increasingly inter-connected networks and devices. We are already well advanced in these plans to create a company that will nimbly adapt to new trends and meet rapidly changing client needs.” Read: T-Systems and Huawei announce a locally based Open Stack Enterprise Cloud for SA
