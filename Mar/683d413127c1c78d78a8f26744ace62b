Minister of Transport, Blade Nzimande, has approved the adjustment of toll tariffs on national roads for the 2018/19 tax year. Gazetted on Wednesday (28 March), the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) said that the adjustments were made in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and VAT increase, and will come into effect on 12 April 2018. “The newly adjusted tariffs will apply on the N3 toll road between Johannesburg and Durban, on the N4 between the Mozambican border and the Botswana border, as well as on the toll road sections of the N1, N2, N17 and R30,” Sanral said in a statement on Thursday. Sanral added that the adjustments are made on an annual basis to keep the toll tariffs aligned with inflation, and that the one percentage point VAT increase is added to the toll tariff and contributed to the upward adjustment. “The effect of inflation means that every rand buys a smaller percentage of a good or service. As the average inflation rate is used to decide the adjustment, this means that there is no increase in real terms,” it said. “Toll monies are used prudently, only to maintain and improve toll roads. Toll roads are built at no cost to the fiscus – the concept of toll roads is to apply a user charge only to those who benefit from the use of the road.” You can find a list of the new tariffs detailed below.
