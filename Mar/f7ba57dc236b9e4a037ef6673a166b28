The Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works says that public comment has closed on a number of proposed changes to be made to the ‘CA’ license plate. Spokesperson for the department, Siphesihle Dube said the final legislation has yet to be promulgated. “After comments have been received, recommendations are made based on the comments, which are then considered by Legal Services. The legislation is currently back with Legal Services,” Dube said. The spokesperson said that the timeframe is completely dependent on the number of comments received and the consideration placed on the comments. Under the proposals, all new vehicles would instead show ‘CAA’ as a replacement for ‘CA’. The change will not affect current vehicle owners or people who wish to transfer the vehicle licence to a different vehicle, but will apply to all new vehicle registrations. A departmental spokesperson previously told BusinessTech that the changes are being introduced because licensing authorities are running out of possible alphanumeric combinations which will inevitably lead to duplicates. He said that this issue is unique to the Western Cape and Gauteng which use a more standardised system when compared to the rest of the county. Gauteng introduced its new system in December 2010 which replaced the “three letters, three numbers” format with the current format of two letters of the alphabet, followed by two numbers, and then another two letters.
