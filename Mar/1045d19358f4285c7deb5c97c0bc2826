With an annual salary of R1.5 million or more as a senior manager or executive, there can be quite a lot riding on whether or not you impress in your job interview. While there are a number of factors which will ultimately influence whether or not you eventually land the position, there are also surefire self-destructive behaviours known to kill a candidate’s interview prospects. This is according to Annelize van Rensburg, director of Signium Africa, a locally based executive search and talent management company. Van Rensburg said that the four following self-destructive behaviours were notable issues in South Africa: “Even senior people scupper their chances through crass errors like these. They are looking for seven-figure salaries and might be experienced personnel in their 40s or 50s, but still self-destruct,” said van Rensburg. “The biggest key is proper preparation. Research the recruiting company (inside out). Read its financial statements and annual reports. Make sure you know the names of the CEO, executive team and board members. Prep for the interview by driving the route to the venue ahead of time. This ensures you know the way, the traffic and the time commitment.Know your CV backwards,” she said. Van Rensburg said it was also important to memorise key dates and bring along extra hard copies to ensure all panel members have your CV. “Punt team efforts and give credit to peers and teams when reviewing career highlights. Be honest.Ask questions that display an interest in the recruiting company, its industry and the position you are targeting. Strategic issues and corporate culture are favoured topics,” she said. “Leave questions about pay and perks until later. Show loyalty to current employers or at the very least display restraint and discretion.” Read: How long you should wait before following up on your job application
