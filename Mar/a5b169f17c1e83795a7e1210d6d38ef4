On the eve of the New York International Auto Show 2018, British car manufacturer Mini has launched an all-electric version of the Mini classic. The classic Mini Electric combines the historic look of the vehicle with new drive technology including zero local emission technology. The Mini Electric concept was announced at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show, and paves the way for the brand’s first all-electric vehicle which will be unveiled in 2019 – just in time for the 60th anniversary of the classic Mini, the group said. The fully electric production vehicle is currently in development, based on the Mini 3 Door, and will be produced for the first time at Mini Plant Oxford next year. “The classic Mini Electric presented in New York will remain unique. A late and carefully restored example of the classic Mini Cooper serves as the basis for this special vehicle. “The exterior red paint is complemented by a contrast white roof and characteristic bonnet strip, with the yellow Mini Electric logo in the brand emblem and on the wheel hubs. The electric classic remains true to the brand, both in terms of its visual appearance and driving characteristics. “The spontaneous power of its electric motor provides a new dimension to the unmistakable go-kart feeling that helped propel the British small car in its original form to worldwide popularity,” Mini said.
