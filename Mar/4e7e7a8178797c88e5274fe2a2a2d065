FNB Connect has announced that it has repriced its data bundles to provide cost-effective solutions to customers. As of 19 March 2018, FNB Connect said that subscribers will receive savings of between 10% and 30% on once-off data bundle purchases for prepaid, postpaid top-up and flexi top-up packages. “This is part of our long-term commitment to minimise the burden of high data costs for our customers,” said Shadrack Palmer, CCO at FNB Connect. In the recent announcement of its interim results, the bank revealed that FNB Connect had grown its subscribers to 600,000 by December 2017. It also confirmed that it had seen a strong uptick during the 2017/2018 festive season which saw it give away up to 3.3 billion megabytes of data to customers who took up qualifying banking products through FNB’s digital platforms. Since the festive season promotion, FNB Connect has seen a 65% increase in daily data usage with the overall data usage increasing by 76% in November to December 2017, said Palmer. “We firmly believe that this trend will continue as smartphone penetration continues to deepen in South Africa, and the integration of FNB Connect gives us the competitive edge to innovate on a greater scale through the use of vast big data capabilities from within FNB,” he said.
