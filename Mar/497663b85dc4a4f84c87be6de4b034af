The Gauteng government has unveiled the first details for its new PWV15 highway. Speaking on the tabling of the provincial budget on Tuesday (6 March), Gauteng finance MEC Barbara Creecy said that the develoment will form part of a significant investment into infrastructure in the Ekurhuleni municipality. “The Gauteng department of transport will receive R6.4 billion in infrastructure money over the medium term. “The most significant project to start in the design phase this year is the PWV 15, the first brand new Gauteng Highway to be built since the 1970s,” Creecy said. R250 million of this is expected to be spent during the design phase of the highway in the current financial year, she said. Aerotropolis While details on the highway were relatively light in the budget itself, Creecy reportedly told journalists in a media briefing ahead of her address that the PWV 15 highway would run east-west, reports BusinessDay. “This will help facilitate and enhance the Aerotropolis in Ekurhuleni and the first phase is going to be dealing with the roads around the OR Tambo international airport and the city of Johannesburg,” she said. “The intention is to try and cut out the Gillooly’s interchange because any of you who travel in the early morning or late afternoon in that area would [know] that it is an area of very intensive congestion. This is particularly when all the trucks and freight vehicles move into that area.” Gauteng had previously outlined its plans for a new highway and other infrastructure developments as part of its new Aerotropolis corridor. The corridor promises to host an number of major ‘catalyst projects’ including new commercial, retail and logistics hubs, as well as a number of upgrades to the surrounding areas.
