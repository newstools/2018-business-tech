Virgin Money South Africa has launched its Online Buying platform, giving consumers more options when sourcing and securing car insurance. Customers can now go online and become fully insured in just 10 minutes, it said. “While many South Africans are used to direct engagement with a call centre agent, an increasing number of consumers prefer using online application tools. Virgin Money Insurance believes that customers should have the ability to choose the sales channel most convenient to them,” said Andre Hugo, CEO of Virgin Money South Africa. This latest innovation addresses Virgin Money’s recent findings, which highlights that one of the biggest frustrations people face when buying car insurance is the feeling of being tossed back and forth within the context of a call centre. Many customers want to both source their quote and sign up online, then and there, Virgin Money said. The Virgin Money Insurance online offering is the latest innovation in Virgin Money’s digital-first drive. Last month it launched Virgin Money Spot, a bank agnostic, peer-to-peer payment application, which simplifies the way people exchange money by removing the hassle of having to exchange banking details to make EFT payments. “Our digital-first strategy is all about making financial services products less complicated, more intuitive, ultimately adding greater value to the way people manage their money,” said Hugo.
