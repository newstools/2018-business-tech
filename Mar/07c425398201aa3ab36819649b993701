Following the recent developments on land expropriation without compensation, the ANC has confirmed that it is now looking at nationalising privately owned water. Speaking in parliament on Thursday, ANC MP Hlomane Chauke said that a National Assembly debate on the takeover of dams as a national resource was on the cards, reports The Mercury. According to Chauke, out of approximately 4,000 dams in the country, only 300 were owned by the government. “Only 4% of African people control land, but not a single black person has a dam. All the remaining 3,700 are in white control,” he said. He added that while the ANC had previously tried to avoid politics in the water space, the issue of dams was now being considered as part of the conversation surrounding land expropriation. As a result, Chauke said that the ANC would also propose the mandate of the constitutional review tasked to consider the land expropriation committee be broadened to include the issue of water. “It is another struggle that we must fight and win,” he said.
