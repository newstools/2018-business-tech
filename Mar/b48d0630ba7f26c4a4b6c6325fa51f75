The City of Johannesburg has announced plans to revamp the city’s licensing centres. In a statement issued on Tuesday (27 March), Johannesburg’s MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun said that these efforts would include the extension of operating hours to include Saturdays. “This means that customers can now visit most of the City operated licensing centres on Saturdays between 8 AM and 12 PM for the renewal of driving licences, vehicle disc licences, register motor vehicles, book driver/learner test, and other relevant services,” Sun said. He added that the extended hours would hopefully see the reduction of long queues, backlogs and turn-around times in these centres. “We have received numerous service related complaints at our licensing centres and it is high time that we improve services to the level that our customers deserve,” he said. “The high volumes of customers visiting our licensing centres means that we need to be innovative and upgrade our centres, we want our customers to get a corporate service as paying customers would expect anywhere else.” Other measures Sun said that his department would be tackling include the removal of unwanted ‘touts’, as well as the introduction of a new customer service experience. Sun added that the City of Johannesburg’s Public Safety department’s social media pages will be updated shortly to indicate which centres will be open on Saturdays.
