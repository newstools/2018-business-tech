Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, says the country’s humanitarian visa programme won’t change to fast-track white South African farmers’ entry into the country – and there are no plans to do so. Bishop was responding to the furore that erupted after Australia’s home affairs minister Peter Dutton said that white farmers should get fast-tracked entry into Australia on humanitarian grounds. Dutton said this week that the Australian government was exploring how to bring white South African farmers to the country on humanitarian grounds due to the recent move by the SA government to change land laws, and also because of rising violence on farms in the country, which were said to be racially charged. According to Dutton, white farmers face “horrific circumstances” in South Africa, and said that a ‘civil’ country like Australia should welcome the skills these farmers have. His comments were labeled as racist, and prompted an official diplomatic démarche from International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, demanding that the comments be retracted. Speaking to Australian media on Sunday, however, Bishop said that there would be no special visa consideration for white South African farmers. Bishop said that the country’s humanitarian visa programme was non-discriminatory and that each application is processed on its own merits, adding that there has been no change to that policy. Bishop confirmed that Australia’s High Commissioner in South Africa was holding talks with the South African Government to clarify the basis of the visa program and to understand what their intentions are with land reforms that the government is implementing. She also noted that the Australian government was keeping track of crime levels in South Africa, and noted with concern the ‘dramatic increase’ in violent crime in the country.
