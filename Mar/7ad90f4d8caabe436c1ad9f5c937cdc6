The Yellow Pages has gone digital to optimise search efficiency and to keep pace with people’s changing habits towards digital, its owner Trudon has said. “Many South Africans remember the trusted, Yellow Pages books that landed at our gates – our go to when we needed repairs or services. The one place we could find anything and anyone we needed.” “The issue has arisen though, that in an increasingly digital world, these books, while remembered with fondness, searching for information digitally is fast becoming the new norm,” the group said in a statement on Wednesday. As from April, the print version of the publication will have a new look and feel, including a new logo, new brand positioning, and a new strategy to increase its foot print. As part of this, the Yellow Pages is also re-launching its app which will eventually see over 100,000 small and medium businesses registered. “This means that the convenience of the old days is now available at your fingertips.” “The Yellow Pages App, like the book, is a database of local service providers you could possibly need in your day to day life – from plumbers to electricians and restaurants and financial institutions,” Trudon said. The app features a chat function which allows consumers to chat directly to potential suppliers in real time. The app also allows a consumer to see average costs as well as ratings and reviews of previous work done. “The Yellow Pages is a heritage brand in South Africa and in moving with the times, we made a decision to keep the element of familiarity but further invest in digital search platforms.” “The changing face of consumers has led us to reconsider how they consume the information we provide. By relaunching, we aim to remain relevant in the market,” said Itumeleng Matlaila, GM: marketing and business intelligence at Trudon.
