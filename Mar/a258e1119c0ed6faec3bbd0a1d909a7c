Accenture Technology is known for harnessing the power of enterprise IT services to drive innovation, deliver cutting-edge solutions, and increase productivity. With an innovation-led approach, the company aims to improve the way the world works and lives – and solves its clients’ toughest challenges. It does this by providing unmatched services in strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations. This strategy allows Accenture to work closely with many companies to help them reinvent themselves to deliver real value to clients through an immersive customer experience and to drive business growth. Through research, Accenture has identified key trends that are transforming society and creating the foundation for future enterprise growth, which was presented in Accenture’s annual forecast of upcoming technology trends. Accenture Technology Vision 2018 digs into the IT trends — including artificial intelligence (AI), advanced analytics, and the cloud — that are reshaping daily life and society and allowing businesses to reimagine what’s possible. According to Rory Moore, Innovation lead for Accenture in South Africa, the trends aren’t about whether is AI coming or not, but about how you can be responsible with it. The cognisance of these trends alone, however, is not enough. Accenture launched a new Liquid Studio in Johannesburg in 2017 that serves to accelerate Accenture’s investment into innovation in South Africa by implementing the IT trends. It is the first of several new Accenture initiatives in South Africa that include expanded investments in training, hiring, and strategic relationships. This Liquid Studio allows clients to work side-by-side with Accenture professionals to fuel innovation and solve critical business problems at speed and scale. By experimenting with disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, blockchain, and cloud architectures, clients can optimise production and efficiencies to reduce development time from months to days, and shorten the time to business impact. “Through these immersive workshops, organisations can now receive a tangible, hands-on experience of how their business can benefit from the most disruptive technologies,” said Willie Schoeman, managing director for Accenture Technology South Africa. “By leveraging agile teams, a startup culture, and multi-speed, microservice, and cloud-based architectures, organisations will see more value quickly and lead in the new digital world.” According to Moore, business-cycle times are shrinking and competitive barriers are disappearing, making speed to market critical in the digital world. Accenture’s philosophy – to change the way businesses think and imagine the future, responding faster, and being the first to introduce your idea the market – is also a key driving factor behind the Accenture Liquid Studio. As part of Accenture Digital, Accenture Interactive – a new initiative that currently includes design and innovation, content, and eCommerce – is expanding its local capability set and is in the process of including digital marketing in an aim to help customers reach the top in an experience-led market. Accenture Interactive helps clients stay relevant in a changing world and creates the best customer experiences globally through connected offerings in design, marketing, content, and commerce. Working closely with Accenture’s Liquid Studio team, Accenture Interactive’s new marketing capabilities enable companies to provide immersive experiences to customers by combining advanced technologies for digital transformation and enterprise-wide growth. “The relationship between Accenture Interactive and the Accenture Technology side has been an important vehicle to morph the worlds of business and tech,” said Moore. “Evolving digitally by implementing tech to business is what Accenture does consistently. As customer experience has become the battleground for brands today, Accenture has recognised that there is a larger transformation at play – a shift beyond digital into an era where tech is built into every single interaction,” he added.
