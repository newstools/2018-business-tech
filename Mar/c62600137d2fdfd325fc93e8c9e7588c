Shares in listed technology group, EOH, came under renewed pressure on Thursday, slumping nearly 10% in afternoon trade on the JSE. The company’s share price declined by 9.26% or R5.51 to R53.99 shortly before 16h00, having dropped as much as 20% on Wednesday after warning that it expects to report a substantial decline in headline earning per share for the six months ended January 2018. In a market update on SENS on Wednesday, EOH said it expected its HEPS to decline by between 20% and 30% from the prior year, although total revenue for the six months is expected to be approximately R8.4 billion, an increase of about 16% indicating a market-share increase, it said. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), EOH warned, is expected to be between R980 million and R1 035 billion, reflecting a decline of between 5% and 10%. “Despite the challenging general market conditions during this period, most areas of the business coped well.

Shares in the company had climbed to nearly R75 in mid-day trade on Tuesday – after it said it would undergo a major restructure which would see it form two independent businesses – having slumped to below R27 in late 2017.
