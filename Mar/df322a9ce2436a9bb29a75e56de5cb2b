Huawei says it will launch six new cloud based services in South Africa in 2018, including a streaming music and a mobile payment platform. The Shenzhen-based mobile and technology company said it will launch these services locally, before moving into the sub-Saharan Africa region. It comes after the group announced in December that it would launch a localised app store in Africa. The app store would be pre-installed on Huawei devices and will include a variety of content. “Huawei’s consumer mobile services in Africa will include an app store for locally-developed games, music, movies, books, and other content,” the company said. “We are also planning to launch African themes and cloud storage.” Huawei underlined the six new services at a media event in Sandton on Tuesday. They include: App Gallery – to include local developers to showcase their apps on the platform.
Theme Store – which offers themes for users’ devices.
Huawei Music – digital music streaming platform. The service will include 80% South African music at launch in 2018. International music will be added thereafter.
HiCloud – a personal data cloud storage service.
Huawei Mobile Payment – a mobile payments platform. Current potential banking partners include Nedbank and FNB.
