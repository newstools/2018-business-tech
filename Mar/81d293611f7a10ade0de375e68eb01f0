Vodacom World, the company’s flagship cellular mall, centrally situated in Midrand, will undergo major renovations for a period of six months and will be closed from 17 March until its re-opening in late 2018. When completed, Vodacom World will showcase the latest consumer technologies and offer a personalised in-store experience, the group said. “When Vodacom World opened its doors in 1998, it was the first of its kind. It was positioned as the showcase of the latest in cellular products and services with Original Equipment Manufacturers partnering in the space to complete the full range or technology available in the marketplace,” said Jorge Mendes, chief officer for sales and distribution for Vodacom. “With the launch of the walk-in customer care environment as well as repairs, it became the place you would come to get any challenge resolved.” He said that the new mall experience will be digital at the core, “with various strategic partnerships bringing this vision to life”.
