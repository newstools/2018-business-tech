SqwidNet, the licensed Sigfox IoT network operator in South Africa, says that it now covers 83% of the local population with its network. The group said that with over 90% and 75% coverage across Municipal and National highways respectively, it has become the fastest growing IoT network in South Africa. Since its launch in late 2016, SqwidNet has partnered with over 30 of ICT service providers who are at various stages of deploying IoT solutions across a number of industry verticals. “IoT and specifically digital transformation journeys that companies are embarking on are expecting to realise tangible benefits either through cost savings or revenue enhancement. We are working closely with our partners and their customers to help realise those benefits,” said SqwidNet CEO, Reshaad Sha. “Customer demand for the type of connectivity and associated devices that we enable has been unprecedented. This demand comes from a wide variety of industry verticals and this in turn has triggered further development in the IoT ecosystem that we participate in,” Sha said.
