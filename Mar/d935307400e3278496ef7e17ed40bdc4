MTN has introduced a new range of pre-paid data bundles. Effective 5 March 2018, MTN said that the new bundles will form part of a number of tailored packages based on customer usage and budget needs, and will reduce overlaps in pricing and bundle size. All new data bundle prices can be viewed using the MTN App or by dialling *141*2#. The tailored bundles can be found on MTN”s website here. VAT increases As part of the statement, MTN said that as a consequence of the increase in VAT from 14% to 15%, announced by National Treasury last month, it will also be adjusting its pricing, effective 1 April 2018. The company said it would provide further details to all its customers, before changes are implemented. Speaking to MyBroadband on Saturday, Vodacom also confirmed that it plans to increase the prices of its services from 1 April, when South Africa’s VAT increase kicks in. Vodacom told MyBroadband that all billable services will be subject to the VAT increase from 14% to 15%, announced by National Treasury in February. “Billable services include contract subscriptions, bundle services, and out-of-bundle rates for voice, data, and SMS services,” said Vodacom. The price increases will be published by 20 March. Weekly data bundles Fortnightly data bundles Monthly data bundles  Read: Blue Label eyes further growth with Cell C partnership
