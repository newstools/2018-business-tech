Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: SARS commissioner Tom Moyane could be out of his position in a matter of days, according to reports, with the issue of his continued presence at the tax service to be raised and debated by cabinet. It is speculated that former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas could take over SARS’ top spot. The South African government has slammed comments from an Australian politician who suggested that visas should be fast-tracked for white South African farmers. The government said that there is absolutely no risk for any racial group in South Africa, and that the country’s land reform will happen in an orderly fashion, in line with the law. KPMG South Africa has been charged and fined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, for improper audits done in 2013 and 2014. The group paid a R1.2 million penalty in the matter, which related to a South African company incorporated in Canada, which was not registered with the necessary oversight board. The political beef between the DA and EFF is one step closer to claiming its first victim, as the red berets have filed intention to launch a motion of no confidence against Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip. The party said the move was punishment for the DA opposing them on its proposal to change land reform laws. South Africa’s rand was firmer on Wednesday as emerging market currencies benefited from renewed demand for riskier assets after the sudden dismissal of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sunk the dollar. On Thursday the rand was at R11.78 to the dollar, R16.46 to the pound and R14.57 to the euro.
