Vodacom has launched a specialist Social Media Command Centre (SMCC) in Cape Town to create a seamless experience for customers – reducing response times and improving overall resolution of customer issues on social channels. Vodacom has seen a 200% increase in total social media queries from customers over the last 12 months. In order to meet this demand, the company will spend in excess of R15 million on staff, equipment, infrastructure and technology over the next year. The operator said it will assign a centralised team of specialists that can quickly scale up or down to meet the needs of any online customer through optimised skills, systems and processes. “The exponential use of social media amongst our customer base has necessitated the introduction of a specialised unit to service these channels. Vodacom is moving to where our customers need us to be and we are scaling up our resources to make sure that we are able to respond faster and engage better through social media platforms,” said Errol van Graan, chief officer: commercial operations at Vodacom. Vodacom said brands are tasked with the challenge of resolving customer service queries through social media. “Given that social media has become the preferred channel of communication for customers to connect with businesses, failure to address these queries in a timely fashion can severely tarnish a brand’s reputation,” it said. First-line Vodacom respondents to social media queries have typically been separated from teams that can resolve customer issues on internal systems. This has proven to be inadequate when it comes to keeping up with the demands of social media savvy consumers, the operator said. “The new model uses a joint team of first and second-line teams operating within the SMCC, who will now be able to create a better online experience, with faster query resolution,” it said.
