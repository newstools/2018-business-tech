Ford South Africa has issued a warning to motorists after it has emerged that a number vehicles could be susceptible to a clutch issue. In a statement published on Tuesday (20 March), Ford said that certain derivatives of Focus, Kuga and Transit and Tourneo Connect vehicles with manual gearboxes could suffer a clutch pressure plate fracture with the risk of fire. “As a precautionary measure, we are directing affected customers to schedule an appointment with their preferred dealer in order to have a diagnostic test completed. “Should there be any evidence of clutch slippage the clutch assembly will be replaced. Any action carried out on affected vehicles will be free of charge,” it said. Ford said that it is also working on a software calibration remedy that will detect excessive clutch slippage and warn the driver to take the vehicle to their preferred Ford dealer. It plans to notify customers when the software becomes available at the beginning of May 2018. “We want to reassure our customers that the affected vehicles remain safe to drive,” it said. “We remain committed to providing our customers with safe and high quality vehicles, addressing potential issues and responding quickly for our customers.” Read: Mercedes-Benz X-Class bakkie – South Africa prices
