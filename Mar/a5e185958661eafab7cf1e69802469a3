The Department of Labour says it is readying an online system for employers acting on behalf of their employees to apply for an exemption from paying the National Minimum Wage (NMW) when it is implemented on 1 May 2018. Mathilda Bergmann from the Department of Labour’s Employment Standards said the new system will require the employers’ financial information, household income, commercial balance sheet, working hours and motivation. After a thorough audit of the company, the department will then determine the granting or rejection of an exemption. Bergmann said the department has drafted regulations to this effect and the bill is currently in Parliament. It had been published for the public to make representation by 16 March 2018. Under the new law, employers will have to pay their staff a minimum wage of R20 an hour with the exception of sectors such as the farm/forestry, domestic and expanded public works programme workers. These latter three groups have been given a longer transition period, being paid R18, R15 and R11 per hour respectively. Read: Some companies could be exempt from having to pay SA’s new minimum wage
