Property developers Abland and REIT Redefine have confirmed that the first stage of its new Loftus Park development will be completed by 1 April 2018. Situated next to the renowned Loftus Versfeld Stadium, the Loftus Park precinct is expected to become a landmark mixed-use development in the region. The precinct totals 55,000 square metres, and will consist of prime-grade office space, a hotel, a premium gym, a private hospital, as well as an open air piazza with restaurants and a convenience retail offering.  Abland said that the core component of Loftus Park will be its P-grade office space, totalling 15,780 square metres in phase one. “Businesses will have the benefit of superior access via the Gautrain bus stop and the new Tshwane Rapid Transport line, making the commute in and out of the precinct quick and easy,”  it said. The precinct will be accredited as a Green Star Building with features including grey water harvesting, back-up generators and 48-hour emergency water supply. The new development also has close proximity to a vast number of embassies, the Union Buildings, the University of Pretoria, top schools, hospitals and museums. “With a Gautrain bus stop adjacent to the precinct, Loftus Park connects easily to the Hatfield station so that precinct users can travel seamlessly to Centurion, Sandton, Rosebank and OR Tambo International Airport,” it said.
