Cell C says that at will zero-rate its streaming platform ‘Black’ over the Easter weekend for current subscribers. In a statement on Wednesday (28 March), the company said that all Cell C customers, whether contract or prepaid, will benefit from this promotion, which kicks off from midnight on Thursday 29 March and closes at midnight on Monday 2 April. The operator said that browsing the platform has also been zero rated for customers on its network. However, clicking through to the betting platform and the ticketing service will be charged according to the customer’s data plan. National data roaming is also not included in this promotion and Black customers that are on other networks will not benefit from the free data promotion. “We know that for many South Africans, getting access to content means that they need to use data. As a holiday treat, we are taking that worry away, giving people a chance to experience the content Black has on offer without using data,” said Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos. Cell C said that the promotional offer is only available on mobile and customers will need to have a positive airtime balance to benefit. “While there is no fair usage policy in place for this promotion, Cell C reserves the right to institute one if we detect high-levels of abuse,” it said.
