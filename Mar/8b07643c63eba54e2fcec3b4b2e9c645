Mercedes-Benz has unveiled some of the details of its flagship X-Class pick-up which will be revealed to the public at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show next week. The X350d 4Matic will be powered by a 3.0 litre turbocharged V6 diesel motor, delivering 190 kW (258 hp) and a maximum torque of 550 newton metres, with peak torque coming between 1,400 rpm and 3,200 rpm. “The top model sprints from zero to 100 km/h in 7.9 seconds,” the German carmaker said in a statement. It said that the permanent all-wheel drive of the X350d 4Matic ensures a high level of driving stability and dynamism under a wide range of conditions – including wet and wintry roads. As standard, the X350d 4Matic is equipped with the 7-speed automatic transmission 7G-Tronic Plus with steering wheel shift paddles and the ECO start/stop function. Mercedes further noted that in Germany it is available at a price from Euro 53,360 (R773,787) (incl. 19% VAT). “To suit the X-Class to customer wishes even more individually, Mercedes-Benz has expanded the extensive range of accessories. New items include three rim designs, the Sports Bar, the Rollcover in black and the Softcover.”  This is how it compares to other SA bakkies Volkswagen Amarok 3.0 V6 TDI double cab Extreme
