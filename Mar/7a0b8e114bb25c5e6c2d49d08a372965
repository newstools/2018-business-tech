Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: Auditors for the Gupta family could face being stripped of their licences, if found guilty of misconduct by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA). The former KPMG auditors will come under the spotlight in at least one inquiry into the firm’s conduct in dealing with the family. The Gupta brothers are currently on the run, wanted on charges of corruption. Energy minister Jeff Radebe says Eskom will finally signed the long delayed contracts with independent energy providers by next week. Eskom has long been delaying the projects, with many speculating it was trying to push nuclear energy. The 27 contracts will add 2GW to the national grid, create 60,000 new jobs, and bring R56 billion in investment, Radebe said. Knives are out for Home Affairs minister Malusi Gigaba, after he ducked and dived this past week, avoiding appearing before parliament to answer for his role in the naturalisation of the Guptas. Opposition parties are calling for his head, saying he needs to be sanctioned for misleading parliament with contradicting statements on the issue. Despite Julius Malema’s often loaded language when dealing with land reform in South Africa, the EFF leader insists he’s not waging a war, but rather pushing debate. He was responding to the hostile reaction from Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini on the matter, after he said the Zulu nation would defend any attempt by the state to take land the Zulus had inherited. The rand weakened on Thursday for a third straight session amid worries that a potential global trade war could curb economic growth and metals demand, overshadowing signs locally of an economic turnaround. On Friday, the rand was trading at R11.91 to the dollar, R16.44 to the pound and R14.67 to the euro.
