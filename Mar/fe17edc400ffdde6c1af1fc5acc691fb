With cars and fuel expected to become more expensive with the introduction of new taxes from 1 April, motorists can also expect to pay more than ever before to fix their vehicles. According to the 2017 Kinsey report, by renowned motor journalist Malcolm Kinsey, it will currently cost up to R44,000 for a basket of parts for an entry level vehicle in South Africa – based on a Datsun GO 1.2 LUX. This equates to 34.97% of the vehicle’s selling price of R126,900. This is in stark comparison to the entry-level class winner of 2008, the Volkswagen Sport 1.4 i, with a parts basket of just over R16,000 – equating to just 19.92% of the vehicle’s R82,000 purchase price. BusinessTech looked at how much it costs to repair an entry-level and executive sedan vehicle in 2017 compared to a decade ago. These vehicle classes were selected as they provided the most transparent vehicle class comparison, and part comparison. The vehicles are also among the most popular on the road today. The outcome is not a like-for-like comparison, but should provide a general idea of how maintenance costs have increased over the last 10 years. Also included is the full 2008 and 2017 Kinsey reports which contain the parts list for each available class.
