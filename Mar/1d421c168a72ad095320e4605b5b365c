The developers of the R1.3 billion Umhlanga Arch have finalised a new partnership to be the home to a state-of-the-art SMG BMW dealership. The luxury BMW dealership will be the base tenant for the development, and will display and feature its vehicles in a completely modernised environment, the group said. Umhlanga Arch is positioned on the slopes of Umhlanga Ridgeside and is a mixed-use development, characterised by an iconic sea-facing arch configuration. The Umhlanga Arch will cover 45,000 square metres, including 163 apartments (30 of which will be loft apartments), and will comprise residential and commercial facilities, including a hotel, with residential space selling for approximately R30,000 – R45,000 per square metre. “With residential offerings almost sold out, office spaces up for grabs and an exquisite European-inspired high street, this development is the pinnacle of urban sophistication and a symbol of this exclusive area’s enviable lifestyle,” the developer said.
