The Guptas came up with a plan to rake in as much as R1 billion a year through government health contracts, the City Press reports – all to pay for a massive private health centre in Dubai. According to the paper, which has seen documents related to the plot, and has spoken to employees at the Gupta-linked companies involved, the idea was to secure lucrative government contracts in all provinces, where the SA government would pay R950 per patient treated. The plan was for the company involved – Gupta-linked Mediosa – to take R650 of every R950 paid to it for healthcare services and funnel it into the family’s accounts in Dubai. Mediosa already has two contracts with the government in the Free State and North West, which were awarded without a tender process the City Press said, but it was targeting other provinces as well, with the plan to have contracts in place worth R950 million a year. The Hawks and relevant government departments are investigating the matter. The full report can be found in the City Press for 18 March 2018. The house of cards built by the Gupta family and their allies in government has slowly crumbled after pressure from civil groups and certain politicians both in and outside of government put pressure on the state to investigate the sordid network of patronage, kickbacks and theft. The brothers are subject to several investigations, some of which are criminal cases, while their business have been blacklisted by South Africa’s banks. Several big multinationals – like SAP and KPMG – have also taken several hits due to their proximity and interactions with the family, while any business that is found to be linked to the family in any way is coming under heavy scrutiny. According to the City Press, the Mediosa contracts are now under threat, following its investigations and revelations that tenders were awarded irregularly.
