Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: VBS Mutual Bank, the bank that gave former president Jacob Zuma his loan to pay for the Nkandla security upgrades, has been placed under curatorship by the South African Reserve Bank, amid “severe liquidity troubles”. The bank has been using municipal deposits to fund its loan book. It is not legal for municipalities to bank with mutual banks however. Tiger Brands is set to face a class action lawsuit for the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa. Human rights lawyers have invited victims of the outbreak to join the lawsuit, which wants to hold the company to account for over 1,000 cases of the disease and 180 deaths. The outbreak was traced back to Tiger Brands’ Enterprise factories in Limpopo. Public protector Busisiwe Mkwhebane has filed papers to fight the punitive costs against her in the Absa/Bankorp case. The judges in the matter found that Mkwebhane had not been impartial, set her report aside, and ordered that she pay some of the legal costs out of her own pocket. The PP is only challenging the cost order. President Cyril Ramaphosa says that ANC would welcome EFF leader Julius Malema back into the party with open arms. Deputy president David Mabuza added that the ANC would be better off with Malema inside that party, rather than heading an opposition. Malema was expelled from the ANC in 2012 for violating the party’s constitution. South Africa’s rand firmed on Friday after US jobs data pointed to slower wage growth, which could temper expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise its forecast for how many times it hikes interest rates this year. On Monday, the rand was trading at R11.82 to the dollar, R16.38 to the pound and R14.56 to the euro.
