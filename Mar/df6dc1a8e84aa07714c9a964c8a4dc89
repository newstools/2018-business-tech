The all-new 2019 Toyota RAV4 made its fifth-generation world debut at the New York International Auto Show on Wednesday, 28 March 2018. The RAV4 leads the compact SUV segment in South Africa with average monthly sales in excess of 500 units, and the all-new model will be introduced locally in 2019. “Designers focused on the key words ‘adventure’ and ‘refined’ to produce a bolder and tougher presence with a lower, wider exterior profile and more sophisticated and premium interior with increased rear legroom. “The adoption of a Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform results in a longer wheelbase and wider front and rear tracks for stable, confident driving while shorter overhangs enhance new RAV4’s ability to overcome rugged terrain,” Toyota said. A new multi-link rear suspension and chassis rigidity that has been improved by 57% contribute to improved handling, minimum interior cabin noise and ride comfort. It has a 2.5-litre in-line four-cylinder engine, which features in both petrol and hybrid models to meet the demand of providing a highly responsive, yet fuel efficient driving experience. An eight-speed direct-shift automatic transmission is mated to the petrol version while hybrid variants are equipped with a continuously variable transmission. A new all-wheel-drive system can send 50% of engine torque to the rear wheels and distribute it to the left or right rear wheel for improved handling. The all-new 2.0-litre petrol engine will be designed specifically for the new TNGA architecture and will also be available with a choice of manual or automatic transmissions. “The new Rav4 will make its local debut in the second half of 2019. The model line-up and specification details will be disclosed closer to launch timing,” Toyota said.            Read: Mitsubishi launches flashy double cab bakkie in South Africa
