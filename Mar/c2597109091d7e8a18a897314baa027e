Lexus has revealed the world premiere of its first compact urban crossover, the UX at Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland. The UX, Lexus said, “marks a series of technical innovations, including the first use of the new GA-C global architecture platform, which delivers fundamental high structural rigidity and a low centre of gravity, thus securing excellent ride quality and stability”. In South Africa, the model will launch early next year and is anticipated to introduce Lexus’ fourth-generation hybrid system which self-charges, boasts a higher efficiency and a more powerful electric motor of 131kW. A new 2.0-litre petrol engine with high thermal efficiency and a new direct-shift continuously variable transmission will also be introduced. The UX will be the fourth addition to the local Lexus luxury utility range, joining the king of SUVs – the LX, the recently launched seven seater RX 350L, and the popular medium compact NX SUV. The UX features powerful bodywork, aggressive rear shoulders and muscular wheel arches that contrast with a sleek, compact cabin profile and a high beltline. “Inside, the cabin offers a driver-focused cockpit with a commanding view of the road as well as an open, relaxing space for passengers and generous cargo space,” it said. The new 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine, that reaps the performance and fuel-economy benefits of high thermal efficiency, will be at the heart of both the UX 200 petrol variant and the UX 250h with its fourth-generation self-charging hybrid system, the motoring company said.
