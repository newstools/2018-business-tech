MTN has announced its new ‘Mass’ SIM card which offers double airtime and data bundles when recharging with R5 or more. “The new Mass SIM card rewards customers with 100% bonus airtime or data bundles each time they recharge,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. “The SIM card doubles the (recharge) value each time when recharged, allowing MTN to further brighten South African’s lives by giving them more value for their rand.” MTN said that the new Mass SIM will be available to all new MTN prepaid customers, and that the bonus airtime and data bundles are valid for 24 hours once activated. The company said that it had introduced the bundles in response to customers tightening their belts and looking for new ways to save amid rising fuel, electricity and food prices. Notably the 1% VAT increase set to come into effect on 1 April 2018 will impact not only basic living expenses, but also the cost of communicating. At the beginning of March MTN confirmed that it would be raising certain prices in-line with the VAT increases, but also announced several new bundles which will form part of a number of  new tailored packages based on customer usage and budget needs.
