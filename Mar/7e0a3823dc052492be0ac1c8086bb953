Google has announced a new job search ‘experience’,  aimed at helping job-seekers find employment opportunities in South Africa. Users will able to view at-a-glance details about the posting, such as job title, location, whether it’s full-time, part-time or an internship, as well as detailed information, should a job be of interest. Using Google Maps integration, job seekers can search for jobs any place they can find on the map, and if they’re signed in, they can even see how long it would take to commute to the job from home. As searching for a job may take time, Google will also allow for email notifications when new jobs matching your search appear. “As this is an open ecosystem, Google is inviting all job sites, platforms and employers — big and small — to integrate with us and make their jobs eligible to display in the new jobs search experience,” Google said in a statement on Thursday. “With Google’s newly released open documentation, any jobs provider is able to integrate its content through open structured schema.org web markup standards we support.” To optimise the feature and make it more useful, Google said it is working with a broad and growing cross-section of the partners, including Job Mail. “These collaborations ensure Google is able to present job postings content accurately, as soon as it is posted, to exactly the people that will find it most relevant,” it said.
