Standard Bank clients are widely reporting continued downtime using the bank’s digital channels, despite a statement from the bank that most of its services have been restored. The banking group was hit with downtime on its mobile and internet banking channels on Wednesday (28 February), due to what it called “technical issues”. Service was restored later in the day, but the bank said that some users would struggle to log on due to the system being overloaded. However, early Thursday morning, complaints from customers again came rolling in claiming that digital services were inaccessible. Responding to complaints, Standard Bank said that it was sill experiencing some technical difficulties – but only related to its banking app. “Following on from yesterday’s technical issues, we confirm that the following channels are now available to customers: ATMs, internet banking, branch and call centre services. We are experiencing intermittent services on the Mobile Banking App.” “Our technical teams are working tirelessly to resolve the issues. You can contact the call center on 0860 123 000 or visit your nearest branch for urgent queries. We will be updating you as we work to resolve the issues with the app,” the bank said. Downdetector, which tracks issues around digital platforms and their online status, received numerous reports on Standard Bank – 88% of which pointed to mobile banking and internet banking still being down. Most users expressed frustration over the downtime hitting at month-end and the end of the financial year for many companies, which is impacting payments and transfers. Others expressed concern over debit orders which may bounce as a result of the downtime. Read: Standard Bank mobile and internet banking down due to technical issues
