Jaguar has revealed major new details on its electric crossover SUV, the I-Pace. Built from the ground up, the new Jaguar I‑Pace is a pure Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), making it one of the few that will be available in South Africa alongside Nissan’s Leaf and BMW’s i Series. Capable of 0-100km/h in 4.8 seconds, the I-Pace has a range of up to 480km (on full charge), and is propelled by two permanent magnet synchronous electric motors. Similar to the technology found in the I‑TYPE Formula E racing car, these motors generate 294kW and 696Nm of torque. With a 50kW DC rapid charger – the kind found at most public charging stations – the I‑Pace can achieve up to 270km of range per hour. Inside the 5-seater you can expect a host of new technologies – including two touchscreens, a 4G Wi-Fi Hotspot, and smart settings which can select preferred seat and mirror positions and play your preferred media at the start of each journey. Originally slated for launch in 2018, Jaguar South Africa has confirmed that the new models will now be available in South Africa in 2019, with pricing and further details expected closer to the date. For the time being, you can get an idea of the customisation options available on Jaguar’s South African website.     Read: How the new Mercedes X-Class V6 compares to South Africa’s top bakkies
