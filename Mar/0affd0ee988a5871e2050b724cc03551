Many of the currencies in our other markets weakened. In Iran, economic  growth slowed somewhat and the rial weakened. Despite these macro challenges, the group continued to deliver on its  operational targets,” MTN said. Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter said: “MTN delivered a solid overall performance for the year, with progress on many fronts, despite difficult economic conditions as well as operational and regulatory challenges in certain markets. MTN Nigeria showed strong constant  currency revenue growth and MTN South Africa’s postpaid business displayed encouraging improvements. “The group’s top-line growth was driven by robust growth in data revenue (on a constant currency basis), supported by the  combination of improving customer service and more stable and competitive networks.” MTN said it spent R31.46 billion in capital expenditure (capex), rolling out a total of 8,583 3G and 8,611 4G co-located sites. Looking ahead, MTN said it is well positioned to capture growth. “Africa and the Middle East are forecast to remain among the world’s key growth regions over the medium to long term. We are confident that MTN is well placed to benefit from this opportunity. “We will continue to leverage our scale and enhance our competitive position, benefiting from favourable demographic growth, low data penetration in our markets and the unique opportunity we have to provide our customers with a range of digital services,” it said.
