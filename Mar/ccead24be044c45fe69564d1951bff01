Former president Jacob Zuma is reportedly being investigated by the Hawks, following claims that he received a bribe of R1 million to ensure that a cabinet minister did not leave his post. According to a report by the City Press, the cash bribe was allegedly paid by a Western Cape abalone dealer in exchange for keeping Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana in Zuma’s Cabinet. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed the matter was being looked at, but said it was still at the inquiry stage. The latest bribery claims, if brought to the NPA, will be added to a long list of similar charges currently being pursued against the former president. The NPA announced this month that it would reinstate fraud and corruption charges against Zuma over the spy tapes issue, where it is also alleged that he accepted bribes on several matters. Zuma’s supporters have criticised the move, saying that it is part of an orchestrated campaign against the former president. Read: Zuma faces trial as NPA reinstates charges
