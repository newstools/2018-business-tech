Listed technology group, EOH, on Monday announced the appointment of Asher Bohbot, the founder and former CEO of EOH, as non-executive chairman. Bohbot replaces Sandile DM Zungu, who resigned from the board after serving as non-executive chairman for over four years. Grathel Motau also informed the board that she has accepted an external permanent executive role, which precludes her from continuing in her role as a non-executive director at EOH. Tebogo Maenetja meanwhile, is appointed as an executive director responsible for Group HR and Transformation, the group said in a statement. EOH has made steady progress to repair its damaged reputation in 2018 having faced allegations of government tender irregularity, which saw its share price plummet in mid December. The group announced the return of former CEO, Bohbot, on a full-time contract to focus on strategy and stakeholder management, days after its biggest share loss. “The intention was always that Asher would return at the end of his six month sabbatical, having stepped down as CEO in May this year,” said CEO of EOH, Zunaid Mayet in December. “Asher brings extensive experience and depth of knowledge to the business, which will be extremely valuable, so I’m most grateful that he’s agreed to join us for a period on a full-time basis.” Read: Asher Bohbot makes EOH return
