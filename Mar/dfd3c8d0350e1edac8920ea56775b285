Telkom has announced that it has zero-rated access to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) website for mobile users on its network – to enable increased voter registration and verification. “This will enable Telkom mobile customers free access to this important platform even if they have run out of data or airtime,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. “As voter registration takes place on 10 and 11 March from 08:00 to 17:00, those on the Telkom network can avoid queuing at these stations by registering on the IEC website. “The website allows voters to verify and update the addresses and outlines the process for registration and re-registration as well as information on the location of the different voter registration locations across the country,” Telkom said. To date the IEC has confirmed a 90% success rate of South African’s verifying their addresses on the website. In addition, 28% of new addresses were added to the voters’ roll via the website. Telkom said that data to this website will continue to be free of charge to all its mobile users until April 2018. Read: MTN announces new pre-paid data bundles and VAT increases
