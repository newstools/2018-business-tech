The Gupta brothers each have multiple South African passports that will enable them to continue to travel for some time. This is according to the Rapport newspaper which said that Atul Gupta currently has three valid passports for South Africa, while his brother, Rajesh, has six. Citing copies of computer records from the home affairs department, Rapport said that a valid passport was delivered to Dubai as early as three weeks ago for Ajay Gupta’s wife Chetali – her third passport. This comes as the Gupta family has fled the country following the resignation of president Jacob Zuma, and as charges begin to  mount relating to alleged state capture. The report stated that on 3 November, when “there were widespread calls for the Guptas to be prosecuted”, the Department of Home Affairs issued two passports to Rajesh. “Both passports were maxi-passports with 48 pages, instead of the ordinary 32 pages,” it said. The two passports were also issued on the same day they were applied for, which the Rapport stated was only usually done under special circumstances. In a separate report by The Sunday Times, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has initiated a process to revoke the permanent residency of Ajay in South Africa.
