Octotel, the country’s second-largest independent open access FTTH network, has announced that it plans to pass over 100,000 homes within the next year. To date, the company has passed over 60,000 homes in Cape Town and plans to extend its coverage further and increase the rate at which the new network is built, it said in a statement on Thursday (29 March). “Octotel built over 700 km of trenched fibre network covering Cape Town’s Atlantic Seaboard, City bowl, Southern Suburbs, Blouberg and Northern Suburbs in 2017.” “The network will likely double its size in the next year, bringing services to more suburbs as detailed by the rollout plan on their website There are 35 ISPs selling FTTH services on the Octotel network,” it said. The group said that it was connecting a new customer to Octotel fibre every 15 minutes, with the demand for FTTH primarily being driven by the introduction and subsequent growth of streaming video services in South Africa, along with the trend of HD digital entertainment moving to the Internet. This, coupled with the dominance of a large number of quality ISPs, requires a more focused approach to building open access FTTH networks at scale to service the growing demand, it said.
