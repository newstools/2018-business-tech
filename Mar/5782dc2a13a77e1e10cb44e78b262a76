Uber has announced that it has added a tipping functionality to its app, which allows riders to show their appreciation for their drivers – or the delivery men and women for UberEATs. The option to tip from a selected range will be presented at the end of any trip of delivery, the group said. Over the past year, Uber has introduced a number of new features in the Uber application to simplify and improve the experience for driver-partners in South Africa. Some of the changes that have been introduced include paid for wait time, notifications of long trips, ratings protection, and an in-app chat function. All tips go directly to the driver or courier, and Uber receives no service fees, it said. At the end of each trip, Uber and UberEATs users will be given the option of various values of tipping, or a customisable amount to their driver-partner or courier. The tipping feature is opt-in from drivers, so the option may not be available on some trips or deliveries, depending on whether the driver or courier has opted to accept tips.
