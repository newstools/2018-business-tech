Hetzner has announced that its hosting fees won’t be affected by the incoming VAT increase. In a statement issued on Monday (26 March), the company said that it had decided to adsorb the costs as it did not believe that the change in the VAT rate was an adequate trigger for a price increase. “As global input costs continue to increase, we may not be able to avoid price adjustments indefinitely,” it said. “But we prefer to look at price increases tied to improvements in our service. If an adjustment is required in the future, we will carefully consider the value we offer our customers.” Hetzner added that it  regularly reviews its pricing and measure the necessity of an increase against three factors: The expertise it offers, that has been developed over many years;
Its investment in its own infrastructure and data centre facilities to deliver a quality business grade hosting experience (comparable to international standards);
Improved hardware specifications over time, that cater to customers’ evolving needs. Read: Teraco has finished building Africa’s largest commercial data centre – here’s what it looks like
