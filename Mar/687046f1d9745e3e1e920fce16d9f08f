The Leonardo, currently under construction in Sandton, has been boosted from 47 floors to 55 – making it the tallest building in the city at an expected height exceeding 180 metres. The Legacy Group and Nedbank building is estimated to cost R2 billion, and will form the foundation for a new urban precinct in Sandton. It is being built on Maude Street – a short walk from Nelson Mandela Square, and its sister building, the Michaelangelo. Initially sold on the phase development of 47 floors, the building has been boosted to 55 floors due to demand. It is a mixed-use development that will offer luxury residential units in the form of apartments and penthouse suites, as well as over 15,000 square metres of premium office space. The development will also house a business and conference centre and other amenities, like a gym and spa, restaurants and a lifestyle and recreation zone. The ‘crown’ of the building is The Leonardo Suite:  a 2,880 square metre apartment with 360 degree views of the surrounding city. Development is well underway, though is unlikely to be completed by its May 2018 target completion date, with 2019 a more realistic date.
