Mitsubishi is offering a special edition Triton Athlete double cab bakkie in South Africa. The sporty new Triton Athlete is assembled in Mitsubishi’s Thailand factory and shares the underpinnings of the top-of-the-range Triton double-cab 4×4 automatic derivative. The Triton Athlete makes use of the 2.4-litre turbodiesel engine with 133 kW and 430 Nm of torque. It will be priced at R559,995 – the same price as the range-topping Triton Double Cab 4×4 Automatic. “The new lifestyle-orientated Triton Athlete does not only look sportier and more athletic than its double-cab siblings, but also offers an upgraded towing capacity of 3.1 tons to tow any lifestyle equipment, as well as increased safety features such as 7 airbags and Isofix child seat anchors for increased passenger and child safety,” Mitsubishi said.
