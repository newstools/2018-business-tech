Google on Monday announced that it has appointed Mzamo Masito as its chief marketing officer for Sub-Saharan Africa. Masito joins Google from Vodacom, where he held a senior position. He has an MBA from the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) as well as a post-graduate diploma from UCT. He lectures at the AAA School of Advertising and serves on the GIBS advisory board. He previously held senior positions at Nike and Unilever. Masito joined Google on 8 January 2018 and is based out of the company’s Johannesburg office. He will be leading the SSA marketing team, working to sustain its momentum and capitalise on its successes in the region, increasing access to the internet, enhancing locally-relevant products and content, and helping people take advantage of the opportunities offered by the internet. “I spoke to a number of people before joining and the consistent theme was Google’s humanity,” Masito said. “The focus on teamwork, love of its people and drive to achieve goals. This is why I joined the company. I hope while I am here I can channel my passion for Africa into the work we do.” Read: Google launches data-saving app in South Africa
