The Department of Labour says that the national minimum wage (NMW) which is set to be implemented from 1 May 2018, will be reviewed and adjusted annually. The adjustments will take effect on the 1st of May every year, after implementation. It was announced late 2017 that a 10-member national minimum wage commission would be set up to assess and review the NMW levels each year, with any adjustments being announced in the March before the increase takes effect. The purpose of the review is to take a number of factors into consideration such as inflation, the cost of living, wage levels, wage differentials, productivity, the ability of business to carry on successfully as well as the impact on SMME’s and employment, and advise the labour minister accordingly. The new regulations governing minimum wage also empowers the commission to promote medium term targets to reduce wage differentials. This will see all minimum wages, including the current exemptions, reaching one level over time. The agreed NMW at National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) is pegged at R20 an hour for major sectors, with the exception of sectors such as farm and domestic workers. These exceptions include: The minimum wage for farm workers will be 90% of R20 per hour (R18 per hour);
The minimum wage for domestic workers will be 75% of R20 per hour (R15 per hour);
The minimum wage for workers on an Expanded Public Works Programme is R11 per hour. The reason for the lower wages for this sectors is due to the higher risk of unemployment for domestic workers if the minimum wage is too high, National Treasury said in its NWM document. Nedlac social partners have agreed that the farm, forestry and domestic sectors will be brought up to 100% of the NMW within two years, pending research by the National Minimum Wage Commission.
