The Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) has revised its estimated “day zero” – they day the taps run dry – with the City of Cape Town now expected to run out of water nine days earlier than forecast. According to the city’s weekly water dashboard, there was 1.4% decrease in dam water levels for the week ending 22 January 2018, meaning that the Cape Town is expected to now run out of water on 12 April 2018. It was previously forecast at 21 April. In a column for the Daily Maverick, Premier of the Western Cape, Helen Zille, said the date may be delayed further as the City and neighbouring towns intensify “throttling”, the process of drastically reducing water pressure in specific areas, where greatest savings can be achieved. “This will inevitably mean that people in high-lying ‘throttled’ areas may have very little water coming out of their taps, for extended periods of time, in the weeks ahead,” she said. However, she warned that day zero had moved from the realm of possibility to a probability. “The province has a mandate to manage provincial disasters,” Zille said. “The question that dominates my waking hours now is: When day zero arrives, how do we make water accessible and prevent anarchy? And if there is any chance of still preventing it, what is it we can do?”  Read: 6 things that will happen when Cape Town’s water crisis hits day zero
