Independent financial services group deVere is set to launch a crytocurrency app, which will allow users to store, transfer and exchange five major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The move follows growing global demand for such a platform, the group said, with the app expected to launch fully within the coming weeks. “2017 saw the true dawn of the financial technology era. Fintech is already fundamentally changing the way we access, manage and use money – and the changes are coming quicker than ever before due to improving technologies and growing demand,” said deVere founder and CEO, Nifel Green. “Nothing has captured the imagination in this new fintech age quite like cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin. No-one was really talking about it back in 2016. But those who invested in Bitcoin before the beginning of last year have enjoyed an impressive price increase. History will teach us that 2017 was the year that digital currencies came into the mainstream.” Contrary to many analysts and financial experts, Green said that pushing against the crypto craze was trying to fight against the tide. The deVere group said it was fully embracing the crypto trends, and its deVere Crypto app is being launched in defiance of financial traditionalism, saying that it is time for consumers to develop their understanding of “this exciting, evolution of currency”. The app will be available for download on Android and iOS in the coming weeks, the group said. Read: What to expect from Bitcoin in 2018
