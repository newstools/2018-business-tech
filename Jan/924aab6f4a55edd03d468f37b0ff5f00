Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: 
Parliament is looking to review its rules relating to removing the country’s president, after the Constitutional Court recently ruled that it had failed in its obligation to hold president Jacob Zuma to account. A committee will come up with a new draft process, which will be debated by the National assembly.
 
Universities and relevant government departments are meeting with political parties this week to try and avoid chaos at tertiary institutions, after the EFF threatened to shut down universities if they do not allow walk-in registrations. The chaos comes on the back of the free education announcement made by Zuma in December 2017.
 
Eskom has reportedly agreed to accept lower-quality coal at a higher price from the Gupta-owned Tegeta Resources and Exploration. Documentation seen by TimesLive is said to show that the agreement for the low-quality coal was struck in December 2017, where Eskom would pay over R200 per ton.
 
Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille could be booted from the position as early as this coming Sunday, after making submissions to the DA as to why she should not be suspended. According to the party, the question is not whether De Lille did anything wrong, but whether she is still capable of leading the Western Cape caucus.
 
South Africa’s rand weakened slightly on Friday as investors bagged profits from a rally that has set the local unit up for its longest weekly winning streak since 2002. On Monday, the currency started that week at R12.32 to the dollar, R16.71 to the pound and R14.82 to the euro.
