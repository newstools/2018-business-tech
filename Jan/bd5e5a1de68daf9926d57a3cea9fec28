The double-cab has continued to dominate South African roads, with the Toyota Hilux and Ford Ranger remaining firm favourites in 2017. This trend is likely to continue into 2018, with notable new entries from Mercedes (X-Class), Renault (Alaskan and the Oroch), as well as updated offerings such as the 2018 Ford Ranger set to come into the local market, meaning more double-cab options available than ever before.
