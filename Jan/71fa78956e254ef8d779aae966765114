Kulula.com plans to make in-flight cashless payments a reality on its planes. The company told MyBroadband it is currently testing a cashless system on its flights, which will remove the need for passengers to pay for items using physical cash. Luane Lavery, Brand Communications Manager at Kulula.com, said they don’t have a specific timeframe for the implementation and launch of the cashless system. “This exciting product is still in the development and testing phase, and we can confirm that both credit and debit cards will be accepted as payment,” said Lavery. Lavery added that the device used to accept the card payments will not be a traditional point-of-sale device, which will be a first in South Africa. Certain domestic airlines allow users to purchase food on their flight using cash, and passengers are often asked to pay with the smallest denominations possible or as close to the price of the item as possible. A move to card payments will eliminate this potential barrier for customers. Kulula.com declined to comment on the connectivity solutions that will be used to process the card payments in-flight.
