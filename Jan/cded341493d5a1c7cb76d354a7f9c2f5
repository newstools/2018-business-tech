Ecommerce and hotel accommodations platform SafariNow.com, has partnered with CM.com for booking-related SMS and email notifications. SafariNow.com uses CM’s messaging as a platform solution to notify its bookers and sellers of booking confirmations, incoming quotes, inquiries and cancellations. It said  that each month, hundreds of thousands of these actions are taking place within the SafariNow.com platform. Matthew Evans, CTO of SafariNow.com said: “The bookers and sellers at SafariNow.com rely on interaction. Not all of the sellers have a global distribution system that distributes the information. Partnering with CM.com gives them a stable and fast communication channel.” For SafariNow.com, reliability and high delivery rates are critical. “The delivery rates must be very high”, Evans said. “CM.com provides an analytics tool that shows real-time information regarding delivery time and rates via CM Analytics. Due to the customer-centric approach that CM.com offers, we chose CM to deliver our bookers and sellers quick mobile communications.” SafariNow.com and CM.com will set-up new ways of managing customer service with CM.com’s customer contact dashboard, which combines multiple channels and chat apps in one dashboard for customer service.
