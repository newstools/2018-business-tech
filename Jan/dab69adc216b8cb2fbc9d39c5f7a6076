Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: Eskom CFO Anoj Singh has resigned from the company amid investigations into his role in state capture at the public power utility. He was suspended in 2017 after accusations emerged that he gave preferential treatment to the Gupta family and their business associates in Eskom contracts. His resignation is with immediate effect. SAB has committed 12 million quart bottles of water – or 9 million litres – to struggling residents in Cape Town once the city reaches the dreaded ‘day zero’. The beverages group said it has not yet started on the plan, but it will be ready by March. Day zero – the day Cape Town’s taps run dry – is expected to hit on 12 April. CEO of Visa, Alfred Kelly, does not see cryptocurrencies as ‘real money’ and says his company is simply not interested in it. Kelly said that the steep price fluctuations of cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum mean they will never be big players in the payments sector, as Visa will stick to processing fiat currency only. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will hold a briefing today where he is expected to lay out more details about the judicial inquiry into state capture. The inquiry, which is based on former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s 2016 state capture report, is supposed to investigate allegations of the Gupta family influencing political appointments through president Jacob Zuma. South Africa’s rand hit a fresh two-and-a-half year high in early trade on Monday, extending a rally driven by optimism about the prospects for change under the new leader of the ANC. On Tuesday the rand was at R12.08 to the dollar, R16.88 to the pound and R14.80 to the euro.
