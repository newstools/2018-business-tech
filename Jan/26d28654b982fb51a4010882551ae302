New World Wealth has released its Global Wealth Migration Review for 2018, which features a host of information about the world’s super-rich – where they’re moving to, what they invest in, and what they spend their money on. South Africa does not feature prominently in the report, but does stand out as having two of the five most popular luxury train services in the world, frequented by the super-wealthy. The famous Blue Train ranks as the third most popular luxury train service, just above the pan-African Rovos Rail’s Pride of Africa journey, ranked as the fourth most popular. Other luxury trains on the small ranking include the Orient Express in Europe, which ranked as the most popular of the lot, followed by the Eastern and Orient Express in Singapore as the second most popular, and the Royal Scotsman in Scotland as the fifth most popular. The ranking was determined by sourcing information among top-end travel agents, as well as tracking the movement of wealthy individuals through the media.
