ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa will reportedly fast-track his bid to remove Jacob Zuma as president, and Shaun Abrahams as NPA head. According to a report in the Sunday Times, the decision comes after Ramaphosa reportedly forced Zuma’s hand in instituting the state capture commission this week, and after Abrahams’ refusal to pursue 10 cases brought to him by prosecutors working on state capture cases last month. A number of prosecutors were said to have met with Abrahams in December, and were prepared to brief him on almost a dozen high-profile state capture cases that they were ready to prosecute. Abrahams was reportedly shocked, and refused to look at the case files, saying he needed to consult with higher authorities. “The prosecutors caught him off-guard and he didn’t know how to handle the matter. He still hasn’t responded to them,” said a senior ANC leader who was briefed on the matter. New powers Ramaphosa was given the power to appoint the head of the National Prosecuting Authority after the December High Court judgement, which found that  Zuma was compromised because of the corruption charges he faced. The vice president now wants these prosecutions to be undertaken immediately and for Abrahams to be removed, according to the Sunday paper. The NEC also has the power to recall any deployee, as was the case with Thabo Mbeki in 2008, meaning that Ramaphosa could potentially call for Zuma to step down at any time. However the Sunday Times reported that the NEC is said to be divided between those wanting Zuma to be removed immediately, those who believe he should be left to deliver the state of the nation address next month and then be removed, and those who believe he should see out his term in office.
