The iconic US-based Ram pick-up may on its way to South Africa, according to Australian site Motoring.com.au, and as reported by Independent Online. Mike Manley, head of Jeep Brand and Ram Brand, FCA – Global, told Motoring.com.au that demand for pick-ups in markets including Australia and South Africa could, ‘could help the turn the tide for the lighter, more advanced new Ram’. “Because it’s not just Australia you know. [There’s] South Africa as well … some of the mines use right-hand drive too,” he said. “It’s something we continue to look at. We’re very closely tied to those guys in those markets,” Manley told the motoring website. “If it becomes viable, you’ll see it,” he said. Ram Trucks, stylised as RAM, is a United States-based brand of light to mid-weight commercial vehicles established in 2010 as a division of FCA US LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Two bakkies dominated the South African landscape in 2017 – the Toyota Hilux and Ford Ranger – selling 36,422, and 32,811 units respectively, ahead of third placed Volkswagen Polo Vivo, with 28,402 units. The 2019 RAM 1500 made its debut at the Detroit Auto Show this week, with the current model starting at $26,495 (R325,500). The Ram would follow the likes of Mercedes-Benz, which is set to launch its X-Class bakkie in the country later this year.
