The World Wealth and Income Database has updated South Africa’s profile, showing how the average salary in the country has changed since 1946, and up to 2016. The online data sets use national accounts, survey data, fiscal data and wealth rankings, and were created by economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and a team of more than 100 researchers from 70 countries. A previous update to the data showed that South Africa had one of the highest rates of wealth inequality in the world, where the country’s wealth became more concentrated among the top 1% and 10% of earners over time. According to the WWID, by 2012, as much as 20% of South Africa’s total wealth was held by 1% of the wealthiest people – while 65% of the country’s wealth was concentrated among the top 10%.
