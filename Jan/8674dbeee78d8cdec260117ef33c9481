Data group Lighstone has provided the sales figures for vehicles in South Africa for 2017, showing which brands and makers topped out as the country’s favourite sport-utility vehicle (SUV). Despite 2017 being an economically turbulent year, new vehicle sales increased by 1.8% according to official sales figures from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa). Even though they carry a typically higher price-point, SUVs sell well in South Africa, though only the Toyota Fortuner sold over 10,000 vehicles, and along with the Toyota Rav4 featured in the top 10 passenger vehicles sold overall in the country last year.
