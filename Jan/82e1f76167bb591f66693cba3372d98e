State power utility Eskom has announced the suspension of  its chief information officer, Sean Maritz. “The temporary suspension of Eskom’s chief information officer, Mr. Sean Maritz, has now been converted to a permanent suspension pending an investigation into allegations of impropriety, the company said in a statement. It follows the resignation last week, of its suspended chief financial officer (CFO) Anoj Singh. Singh was suspended by the power utility in September 2017, after being placed on special leave at the end of July, Fin24 reported. This came following allegations that he was involved in irregularly awarding contracts to Gupta-linked businesses, and also received gifts and trips from the controversial family. Eskom on Tuesday published its interim results for the six months ended September 2017, showing a 2% decline in revenue to R95.5 billion. The company continues to deal with a lack of liquidity, poor governance and corruption, and was downgraded by ratings agencies late last week over concerns about its finances. The group said that profit for the period dropped from R9.5 billion to R6.3 billion, while profit before depreciation and amortisation expense and net fair value gain (EBITDA) declined to R29.6 billion, from R31.8 billion before – due to a 2% tariff increase and declining sales.
