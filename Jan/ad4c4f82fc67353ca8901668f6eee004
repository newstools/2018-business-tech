Toyota South Africa announced on Thursday that it would be recalling over 700,000 of its vehicles over airbag safety concerns, with some affected models dating back over 15 years. A Toyota official told Reuters that 10 models, including Lexus, are affected. “The reason for this is certain types of airbag inflators manufactured by Takata were found to have a potential for moisture intrusion over time,” Toyota said. “Depending on the circumstances, this could create excessive internal pressure when the airbag is deployed and cause the inflator to rupture. “In the event of an inflator rupture, metal fragments could pass through the airbag cushion material, striking and possibly injuring the occupants in the event of an accident. To date, no injuries or fatalities caused by this condition have been reported locally,” it said.
