2017 was a tough year for South Africa’s economy, which fed into all sectors of the market. Low consumer and business confidence led to low economic activity, which ultimately pushed the South African economy into a brief recession in the second quarter of the year, as households came under financial strain. However, despite the economic slump, South Africa’s new vehicle industry bucked the trend, ending 2017 in positive territory. Despite December 2017’s year-on-year sales declining 2.4%, the year-to-date new car sales for 2017 grew 1.8%. Data from lenders such as WesBank also showed that there was a continued shift back to new vehicle purchases among South Africans, especially when measuring demand through the number of vehicle finance applications received. Demand for new vehicles rose 6.4% in December, while demand for used vehicles slowed 0.2%, the group said. Annual sales data from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) showed that a total of 557,586 new vehicles were sold in South Africa during 2017.
