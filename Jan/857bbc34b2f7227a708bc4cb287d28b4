The Financial Times has published its Global MBA Ranking for 2018 with two-year programmes filling nine out of the first 10 places, while Insead’s one-year MBA, top for the past two years, falls to second place, behind Stanford Graduate School. University of Pennsylvania: Wharton placed third, followed by London Business School’s two-year programme – the top British MBA. Stanford goes back to the top thanks to a significant salary boost, up nearly $20,000 to $214,000, the FT said. And despite its location in Silicon Valley in California, a third of alumni work in corporate finance, the report said. Hough Graduate School of Business at the University of Florida is regarded as the top in value for money despite alumni’s average salary being in the bottom fifth of ranked schools at $106,000. The 16-month MBA has a manageable tuition fee ($30,000), and one of the lowest opportunity costs thanks to being the shortest programme on average in the US. The FT ranking is based on surveys of the business school graduates, career progression of alumni, idea generation and diversity of students and faculty. These are the 15 best business courses in the world, according to the Financial Times. Read: The best MBA schools in South Africa – and how much they cost
