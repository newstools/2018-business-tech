Multichoice has announced that it will be dropping the Gupta-linked ANN7 news channel from its channel bouquet, and is open to proposals for a new black-owned news channel. Multichoice South Africa CEO, Calvo Mawela made the announcement at a press briefing in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The group said that a board investigation into its contracts with ANN7 revealed that the media group had “made some mistakes” in dealing with the then-Gupta-owned news channel, but did not turn up any form of corruption. “There was no evidence of corruption or any illegal activity. We acknowledge that we should have looked into the controversies around ANN7 before public concern was raised, and this should have been escalated to the board sooner,” Mawela said. In light of this, the CEO said that Multichoice would not be renewing its contract with ANN7, and instead will be hosting a new black-owned news channel. “We will be calling for proposals from interested media groups very soon,” Mawela said. Multichoice was facing mounting scrutiny over its contracts with ANN7 as well as the SABC, and has been facing accusations that it tried to buy influence with government through the contracts, to hold sway over the digital TV migration and set-top box saga. Icasa announced this past weekend that it would be investigation the accusations. At the Multichoice press briefing, Mawela admitted that the group did not conduct its due diligence in entering into deals with ANN7, and that its lobbying practices in approaching the news group were not up to standard.
