Financial group BayHill Capital has published an inforgraphic summarising the events and situations that shook up the JSE in 2017. 2017 was a turbulent year, both politically and economically in South Africa and abroad. The country faced internal political conflicts as divisions in the ruling ANC led to a number of political appointments and firings which hit the economy hard – while globally, the world had to deal with the new reality of a Trump-led United States. Economically, South Africa faced a brief technical recession amid dropping business and consumer confidence, while on the global scale crpytocurrencies were the hot take of the year, where investors saw Bitcoin climb to unthinkable highs. Despite the ups and downs, BayHill’s data shows that the JSE All Share had a strong year, growing 14.1%, or 7,178.86 points. The market saw a high of 61,211.52, and a low of 50,474.95, a fluctuation of 10,736.57 points throughout the year. The All Share started 2017 at 51,020.66 – compared to the start of 2018, where it sat at 58,199.52. This is what rocked the JSE in 2017.  Read: How politics rocked the rand in 2017
