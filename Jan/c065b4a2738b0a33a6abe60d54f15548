The Department of Water and Sanitation is expediting the roll-out of pressure management technology to various parts of the water supply network in the City of Cape Town in response to the drought. “Not only does pressure management generally lower consumption by reducing the rate at which water flows to properties, it also reduces leaks and pipe bursts by better ensuring that pressure remains within levels that the pipework can tolerate, and reduces the rate of loss from leaks and bursts,” the city said in a statement. The city has identified 25 areas that could benefit from pressure management over the next three months, and contractors have been brought in to speed up the programme. “The first planned works in this regard will take place in Paarden Eiland, in the area bounded by Marine Drive Service Road to the north, Duncan and Lower Church Roads to the west, Paarden Eiland Road to the east and FW De Klerk Boulevard (N1 freeway) to the south. Some 367 customers will be affected,” the city said. The work is scheduled to take place on Friday (12 January) from 8pm till Saturday at 4am. Other areas will be informed of supply disruptions in due course. “At all times, careful consideration will be given to ensure minimal disruption to the water supply in the affected areas,” the city said. The city has apologised for any inconvenience caused by this intervention. Read: New Cape Town water restrictions begin
