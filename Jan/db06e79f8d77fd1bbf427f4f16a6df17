The South African Post Office (SAPO) has released its updated list of fees for postal services across South Africa. The new fees will be implemented as of 1 April 2018 and will see an increase in the cost of sending of ordinary domestic and internal mail, packages, as well as the purchasing of stamps. 2018 is expected to be a big year for the post office after government announced in December that it would take over the distribution of welfare grants from current service provider Net 1 UEPS Technologies. The postal service is also expected to be granted a full state bank licence before it begins distributing social grants in April 2018. Domestic parcel rates Any postal item larger than 250 x 353 mm and/or thicker than 30mm and/or weighing more than 1 kg will be considered a “parcel” by SAPO. It will also charge R52.50 for the first kilogram for counter to counter deliveries, with an additional R7.05 charged for each additional kg or part of a kg. Insurance is an optional extra, and the sender has the option of insuring the ordinary parcel at a rate of 3% of the declared value up to a maximum of R5,000 with a minimum rate of R4.20 per parcel.
