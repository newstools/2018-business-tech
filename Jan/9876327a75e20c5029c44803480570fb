Investment research firm, Morningstar, has recently published its latest analysis of South African asset managers, detailing which of the country’s top fund managers have delivered the best returns. The research is calculated on a quarterly basis and provides an assessment of the risk-adjusted return of all South African-based unit trusts carrying a Morningstar Rating. Morningstar stressed, however, that the ranking is not designed as a forward-looking tool – and does not indicate the future positioning of asset managers. Often called the ‘Star Rating’,  it is a quantitative assessment of a fund’s past performance and is measured from a minimum of one to a maximum of five stars. The rating delivers an overall-weighted and an asset-weighted ranking of asset managers and their rated range of South African domiciled funds. The ranking by overall-weighted Morningstar Rating mirrors the average quality of the overall fund range given that all funds are weighted equally. The asset-weighted ranking gives an assessment of an asset manager’s weakness and strength, in light of how investors allocated assets between available investment options within the fund range. South Africa’s largest private asset manager, Allan Gray, along with Fairtree Capital, topped the list of the country’s best fund managers for investment performance. Prudential Investment Managers climbed to third, up from previous quarter.
