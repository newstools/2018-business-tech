Jobs portal Careers24 has published its recruitment data for 2017, showing which job sectors were in the greatest need of skilled staff during the year. According to Careers24, the number of job vacancies applied for were slightly lower than the previous year – a possible indication that tough economic conditions had an adverse impact on the business sector, with uncertainty affecting job posters and seekers alike. In total, over 680,000 searches were made on Careers24 during 2017 compared to a little more than 550,000 in 2016. However, the total number of applications made declined from approximately 650,000 in 2016 to just under 560,000, “showing that candidates are thinking carefully about which companies they would like to work for,” the group said. Despite the static application numbers, 2017 was still very active for first time job seekers, it said, adding that over 100,000 candidates searched for work opportunities. Looking specifically at job sectors where the most opportunities were present, the IT sector far outweighed any other, with an average of 6,264 new listings on the site each month. The closest sector to that was in sales, with 1,976 listings per month. The table below outlines the 10 sectors with the most jobs posted in 2017: According to Careers24, while the last quarter of the year generally sees a decline in activity in the recruitment market – due to holidays and festivities – January is a time for new resolutions and results in a spike of job hunters. “We’ve also noticed an increased interest in researching a company thoroughly before applying to work there,” it said. Most job seekers hit the site on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, while recruiters typically post jobs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, the group said.
