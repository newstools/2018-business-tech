The rand is currently enjoying one of its longest winning streaks since 2002, with the currency trading at R12.37 to the dollar on Monday, 8 January. Notably it has been on the front foot since December, supported by investors’ hopes that the newly elected leader of the ruling ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa, would push through business-friendly policies. However, a Reuters poll held on Friday (5 January) found that the run is likely to end soon, with technical indicators now suggesting the rand is overbought. There are also doubts about how much Ramaphosa, a promised reformer, can do for South Africa’s ailing economy, with the polled strategists saying that the rand is likely to weaken by as much as 12% by the end of 2018. This means that those looking to travel internationally may find that they will be getting the best bang for their buck right now.
