Ford this week launched a limited edition Mustang Bullitt at the Detroit Auto Show 2018, to tie-in with the 50th anniversary of a Steve McQueen film that shares the same name, in which he drove the original 1968 Mustang GT Fastback. The third-generation vehicle is without stripes, spoilers or badges, like its predecessors. Previous versions were sold in 2001 and 2008. The special edition vehicle is due out in the summer, and will be available only in Shadow Black or Dark Highland Green. It boasts a 5-liter V-8 engine that packs at least 475 horsepower and 420 lb.-ft. of torque. It tops out at 163 miles per hour (262 km). The only transmission offered will be a manual 6-speed. “The gear shifter will feature a cue ball shift knob; a nod to the original,” Ford said.
