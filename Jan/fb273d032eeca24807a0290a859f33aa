Car advertising website, Cars.co.za has announced a list of 13 winning cars across a range of categories in its third annual consumer awards in conjunction with WesBank. The winning vehicles were announced at an event held at Vodaworld in Midrand, on Thursday evening, 25 January, 2018. The Grand Prize of the night, South Africa’s Brand of the Year, was for a second time won by Suzuki South Africa. The finalists – three in each of 13 respective categories – were selected out of 65 vehicles that seven members of Cars.co.za’s extended editorial team agreed were the best derivatives available in the South African new vehicle market in the fourth quarter of 2017. To reduce the selection of vehicles per category from five to three, the same team ranked the contenders by evaluating them against predetermined pillars of success in each category. No fewer than 20 brands are represented in the list of finalists, with the Volkswagen Group leading the nominations with 10 derivatives (Audi and VW had five apiece), followed by the BMW Group (four). In November last year a combined panel (the Cars.co.za editorial team and 11 guest judges) evaluated the finalists back-to-back during a two-day test at Gerotek. The findings of the 18 judges accounted for half of the finalists’ total scores – the other half were based on rankings that the respective vehicles’ brands achieved in the Cars.co.za Ownership Satisfaction Survey, in partnership with data specialists Lightstone Consumer. The data incorporated feedback from thousands of vehicle owners, based on their experiences of their vehicles. For 2017/18, the categories were updated in consideration of new vehicle sales trends, such as increased demand for small/compact crossovers, public preference for SUVs over sedans and MPVs, and to better distinguish between road-biased Executive and off-road Adventure SUVs.
