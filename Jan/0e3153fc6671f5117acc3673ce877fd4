The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised South Africa’s economic growth forecast downward in 2018 and 2019 as a result of rising political uncertainty which it says weighs on confidence and investment. It projects the country’s economy to grow by 0.9% over the next two years, down from a projection of 1.1% in 2018 it forecast in October, and 1.6% in 2019. “The growth pickup in Sub-Saharan Africa (from 2.7% in 2017 to 3.3% in 2018 and 3.5% in 2019) is broadly as anticipated in the fall, with a modest upgrade to the growth forecast for Nigeria but more subdued growth prospects in South Africa, where growth is now expected to remain below 1% in 2018–19, as increased political uncertainty weighs on confidence and investment,” the IMF said. The IMF noted that the numbers predated the most recent developments in the country, notably the election of deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, to the position of president of the ANC in December, and talk that current president, Jacob Zuma, may be forced to step down imminently. Ramaphosa is expected to adopt more business-friendly policies, even though he enjoys the support of the communist party and the biggest labor union federation. His election as ANC leader helped boost the rand 10% last month, Bloomberg reported. On Monday, the rand firmed against the major currencies: Dollar/Rand: R12.11 -0.52%
Pound/Rand: R16.86 -0.39%
Euro/Rand: R14.83 -1.42% The IMF’s forecast comes only days after the Reserve Bank revised its forecast for GDP growth up from 0.7% to 0.9% for 2017; while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 were adjusted to 1.4% and 1.6% respectively, up from 1.2% and 1.5% previously. Global growth will accelerate to the fastest pace in seven years as US tax cuts spur businesses to invest, the International Monetary Fund said, as reported by Bloomberg.
