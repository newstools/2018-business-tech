Local food delivery service, OrderIn, has teamed up with ride hailing app Taxify, to expand the reach and offering of both companies looking to grow their customer base in South Africa. The service could aim to challenge competitor Uber, which launched UberEATS in Joburg in the fourth quarter of 20126 and has been rolling out the service ever since. The partnership will offer incentives to customers and additional earning power to Taxify drivers. “It all comes down to scale, with more scale we can offer greater efficiency to our customers and reduce our prices – even further,” said CEO and founder of OrderIn, Dinesh Patel. The collaboration will be promoted through social media, in car and in app. Discount coupon codes will be offered to first time OrderIn and Taxify users and ongoing exclusive incentives will be made available to regular customers. “We’re continuously on the look-out for innovative ways to incentivise our drivers and grow our customer base in local markets. The partnership with OrderIn was a logical next step for us,” said operations manager for Taxify, Sinako Cetyiwe. Launched in 2012, OrderIn has a network of over 1,200 restaurants, in all the major metropoles. The locally founded business is the most affordable food app on the market with a R10 delivery fee. Taxify, which re-launched in South Africa in 2016, already operates in 20 countries worldwide. Read: South Africans can expect to do more ‘grocery shopping’ through UberEATS
