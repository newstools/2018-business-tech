Listed ICT group Jasco says its channel business has launched a new partner portal aimed at channel partners and end user customers of their interaction recording and management solutions. The portal provides reseller and channel partners with a self-service platform on which they can access product and marketing information, do product training through webinars and online micro-courses, design and build their own solutions, create quotes, download updates, and access a host of other relevant and value-added services. Portal users will also be able to engage with Jasco through the platform to place orders, liaise with sales teams and solutions architects, log faults and otherwise communicate. This forms part of Jasco’s initiative to provide a superior customer experience through simplified engagement and easily accessible information, the group said. The portal is available 24 hours a day, and will be constantly updated to provide users with the most accurate, up-to-date information available. It will also enable channel partners to log and track their leads, quotes, solution proposals and sales performance, providing them with a valuable sales tool. Partners will have full access to easy reporting structures to track and manage opportunities, while benefitting from more effective guidance from Jasco’s portal and channel managers. The Jasco Group has a national footprint with offices in Gauteng, Western Cape, Free State, Eastern Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal. Read: Jasco buys 51% share in Reflex Solutions
