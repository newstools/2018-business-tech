Internet Solutions says it will partner with Cell C to expand its LTE service offering, providing consumers with alternative services within the fixed broadband market. Through the partnership, IS said it is reinforcing its position of promoting an open access network to offer more choice to channel partners and clients. Internet service providers (ISPs) can now choose from a selection of Cell C packages ranging from 50 to 200GB per month, with the option to top up at any time with 30-day packages ranging from 1 to 20 GB, managed through IS’ integrated billing and management platform. Cell C’s network footprint in South Africa  includes 2,900 LTE base stations in the major metropolitan areas of Gauteng, Kwazulu-Natal and the Western Cape, operating on two key bands including 1800MHz and 2100MHz. It offers network speeds capable of up to 100Mbps, IS said. “High density LTE coverage offers customers distinct advantages over wired networks such as ADSL or fibre, and customers benefit from fast delivery of services with minimal disruption during installation, at lower capital and environmental costs,” the group said. Cell C CEO Jose dos Santos said that the partnership with IS would allow the company to reach a new segment of the market as its increases its broadband footprint across the country. “LTE is regarded as the future of wireless connectivity, enabling customers to be part of a constantly-expanding network. The Cell C networks already extend across South Africa’s major centres and metropolitan areas, and new sites are added weekly, enabling partners to offer customers comprehensive access,” IS said.
