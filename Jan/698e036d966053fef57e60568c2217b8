South Africa can now boast its first business school to accept Bitcoin payments for all degrees, advanced diplomas, certificates and online courses. Red & Yellow, which has campuses in both Cape Town and Johannesburg, says it is focused on preparing its students for career success in a digital future, so the acceptance of the next wave of financial currency is the obvious route. “The world is changing rapidly, as are our students and it’s our responsibility to ensure we are serving their future focused needs” said Rob Stokes, chairman of Red & Yellow and founder of digital agency pioneer, Quirk. “The reality is that Bitcoin is here to stay and with many youngsters having made a good return on their investment in cryptocurrencies, they now want to use this digital cash to invest in their education, as future leaders.” Prof. John Simpson, former head of management studies at UCT, who is now leading the same faculty at Red & Yellow, said: “Not only will this make our offerings more accessible to the public – individuals and organisations – but it will set us apart on an international scale, regardless of the market.” Read: This graph shows just how popular Bitcoin is in South Africa
