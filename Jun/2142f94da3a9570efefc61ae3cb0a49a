Private and investment banking group, Investec has published its annual report for the latest financial year, revealing how its top executives were paid over the period. According to the report, exiting Investec CEO Stephen Koseff was paid a total package of £3.503 million for the period, which included a basic salary of £1.694 million, a £809,000 bonus and £1 million in shares. The group’s managing director, Bernard Kantor – who is also stepping down from the group – was paid exactly the same as Koseff. Converted into rands at the current rates (R18.06 to the pound), the duo’s salaries are easily some of the highest among South African bankers at R63.25 million. Koseff’s and Barndard’s total pay did not include the outstanding £1.48 million that forms part of a long-term incentive that was awarded, as this amount will be forfeited. This is because both executives are stepping down from their roles, and on termination of employment, outstanding long-term incentive awards will be pro-rated based on time served relative to the performance period of the award, the bank said. Also stepping down is executive director for group risk and finance, Glynn Burger, who earned £3.095 million (R55.9 million). CEO of Investec Asset Management, Hendrik du Toit, received the biggest paycheque of £6.088 million (R109.9 million). He was awarded a bonus of £5.637 million, determined solely in relation to the performance of Investec Asset Management – 20% of which he reinvested in the company’s shares to be held for three years.  New executives Du Toit and Fani Titi have been appointed as joint CEO designates with effect from 1 April 2018. From April 2019, Ciaran Whelan will take over as group risk director and Kim McFarland wall take over as group finance and operations director. As part of the remuneration report, Investec has put forward proposed salaries for these executives for the current financial year.
