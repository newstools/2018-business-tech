Toyota is expected to launch what car specialists are calling a ‘baby Fortuner’ in South Africa within the coming months. As previously reported by BusinessTech, a version of the Toyota Rush will be launched as a budget-conscious SUV locally, having already launched in Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also expected to launch in India and the UAE. The Rush contains a 77 kW/137 Nm 1.5-litre petrol engine, which is paired with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Design-wise, is is reportedly very similar to the Daihatsu Terios – which was discontinued from the local market in 2015 – and is a brand that belongs in the Toyota stable. While Toyota is yet to officially confirm the car’s launch in South Africa, CarMag has spotted a promotional Instagram post from Freeway Toyota which gives an idea of how the car may be priced. While the advertisement provides no official launch date, it states that both an automatic and manual variant will be available in the country. The five-speed manual version is price at R302,900, and the four-speed automatic model at R316,600. Toyota South Africa had not replied to comment at the time of writing.
