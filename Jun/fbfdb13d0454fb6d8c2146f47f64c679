The AfroVoice newspaper – formerly known as The New Age – will reportedly no longer be in production with immediate effect. Speaking to News24, Cape Town-based AfroVoice journalist Vincent Cruywagen said that the news was announced by owner Mzwanele Manyi during a staff meeting on Thursday. Manyi reportedly asked staff members to remain at home until further notice, but confirmed that they would receive their July salaries. Another Johannesburg-based AfroVoice journalist confirmed that they were pulled into a meeting just before the end of the day, and told that they no longer had jobs. Manyi purchased the New Age and news channel ANN7 from the controversial Gupta family in 2017. He subsequently changed the name of both the channel and the newspaper in April 2018 in an attempt to separate the two properties from their controversial past. Manyi’s 24/7 news channel, Afro Worldview, is also expected to stop broadcasting on DStv on 20 August after the satellite company announced that it had terminated its contract, and were looking to replace the slot with another black-owned news channel.
