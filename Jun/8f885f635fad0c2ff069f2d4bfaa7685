South Africa has been named as one of the most inclusive nations in the world – behind only Canada and the USA – when it comes to social acceptance on the basis of religion, immigration, sexual orientation and gender identity, political views, and criminal background. Notably, while South Africans are near the top of the rankings when it comes to religion, immigrants and LGBT Inclusiveness – we top the rankings when it comes to being the nation most inclusive of people with criminal backgrounds and extreme political views. This is according to a new Inclusiveness Index, based on the findings of an Ipsos Global Advisor survey conducted in April and May 2018. For the study, Ipsos interviewed over 20,700 men and women in 27 countries, asking questions about as many as 28 different ‘types’ of people. For each type, respondents were asked if they consider such a person to be a ‘real’ national (e.g., ‘a real American’ in the US, ‘a real Brazilian’ in Brazil, etc.) or not. The overall Inclusiveness Index score is calculated by averaging the net scores (‘real’ percentage minus ‘not real’ percentage) for six constructs: Religious Inclusiveness (average of net scores for each of Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, and atheists) – led by France and Canada;
Naturalized-Citizen Inclusiveness (net score for naturalized citizens) – led by the US and Australia;
Second Generation Inclusiveness (average of net scores for native-born people whose parents immigrated from nine different regions of the world) – led by Canada and Chile;
LGBT Inclusiveness (net score for gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people) – led by France and Canada;
Criminal Background Inclusiveness (net score for people who have been convicted and incarcerated) – led by Canada and South Africa; and
Extreme Political Views Inclusiveness (net score for people with extreme political views) – led by South Africa and the US.  Watch: Coalition scenarios to consider ahead of the 2019 elections
