Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: Government’s agreement to hike wages for public servants has blown the budget by R30 billion, which has led to a decision to start ‘encourage’ thousands of workers over the age of 60 to take early retirement.

Sales slowed to 0.5% as VAT increased to 15% and motorists saw a massive hike in the petrol price. Adjusted for seasonal trends, it was a contraction of 1.2%. Only furniture retailers bucked the trend, increasing sales by 11%. [Stats SA] Eskom says it can’t guarantee that South Africa’s power isn’t under threat, as workers threaten to throw the country into darkness as they strike for higher wages. Eskom said that all its stations are running, but several are being affected by worker strikes. Some stations are already facing a coal supply crisis.
