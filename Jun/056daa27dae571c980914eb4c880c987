South African billionaire Douw Steyn’s Fourways Palazzo has been featured on SABC lifestyle programme, Top Billing, giving us a rare look into the lifestyle of one of the country’s wealthiest men. Steyn, who made his name in insurance, is estimated to have a net worth of £900 million (R16 billion), making him one of the richest people in the country. As part of his more recent projects, the insurance and property mogul is building an eco city just outside Fourways called Steyn City, which is a multi-billion rand mixed-use development project – also home to Steyn’s very own “palace”. The 3,000 square metre home, dubbed “Palazzo Steyn” (Steyn Palace) was valued at R250 million four years ago when it was completed, and is said to be the most expensive home in the country. As implied by its name, the mansion takes most of its inspiration from classical Italian design, including the the bronze dome in the entrance hall, the marble floors, and many of the internal finishings. The mansion also features an aqueduct that almost completely circles the property, designed to look as if it has collapsed over a gorge. Inside, some of the lounges echo ‘Gatsby-era’ decor and design, while the outdoor areas feature stylings from Europe, India, the Middle East and even Africa. This is how it looks inside the Palazzo, including images from DBM Architects, which designed the home, as well as shots of it furnished, as featured on Top Billing.
