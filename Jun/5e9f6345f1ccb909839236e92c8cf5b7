While the statistics may paint an alarming picture, the reality around property as an investment choice is quite different, argues Mike Greeff of Greeff Christie’s International Real Estate. According to FNB’s Property Barometer statistics for the past 18 years, it shows that if a buyer purchased a home in 2008 for R1,000,000 during the recession, in 2018 the home would be worth R7,184,528.90. Whereas, if you invested R1,000,000 in the bank in 2008, you would only yield R3,996,019.50, further proving property to be the sounder and more profitable investment, said Greef. Investors both locally and internationally endorse property as a stable investment vehicle. This can be attributed to constant demand combined with excellent value-for-money homes that Cape Town offers. According to statistics, local buyers are still being approved for bonds on a steady basis, further lending to the fact prospective buyers are in good credit standing. “While there may be some temporary slumps in the market, investors can rest assured that the market will always recover from them. Investing in property is a long-term investment and should be seen as a marathon rather than a sprint,” Greef said. As for sellers, it is imperative to correctly price your home from the start. The current market dictates that homes that are realistically priced within their areas, will record less days on the market, thus ensuring a swift sale, he said.
