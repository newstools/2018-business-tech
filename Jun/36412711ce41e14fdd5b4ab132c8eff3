True Price has officially launched on Friday, “offering motorists a precise and realistic evaluation of the value of their vehicle”. The prices are based on data garnered at thousands of vehicle auctions. Significantly, these evaluations are available free of charge to motorists, it said. “We envisage that True Price will be used by millions of South African motorists. Dealers and auctioneers will find True Price to be an invaluable resource too,” said the website’s owner, Darryl Jacobson. “We’re constantly adding to what is already a massive database of prices attained on auction,” he said. “We have made it as simple to use as possible,” Jacobson said of the site. “He said users need simply submit an enquiry online and within 24 hours, “we will give them the real value of their car.” He believes that the sales prices achieved on auction are a true indication of what a car is worth. “Nowhere else can you get such a realistic valuation – because these are actual recorded sales. I do not believe that any other database is as meaningful as ours,” he said. Read: Find out how much your car is worth on SA startup CarZar
