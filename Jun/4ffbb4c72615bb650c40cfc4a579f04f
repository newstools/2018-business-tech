FNB has released its banking fee changes for the the 2018/19 financial year, which will come into effect on 1 July 2018. Banking fees have been impacted by the recent VAT hike to 15%, which have translated to a 1% increase in fees across most of South Africa’s banks – though some costs have been absorbed by the banks. For FNB customers, the VAT hike means year-on-year price changes to the bank’s pay as you transact fees are slightly higher. For 2018/2019, notable account pricing changes include: FNB Easy Pay-as-you-use (PAYU) account fee increases from R5.25 to R5.75 per month.
FNB Easy Bundle Account increases from R53 to R58 per month.
The FNBy account for youth younger than 18 remains affordable with no monthly fees.
The mid-level FNB Gold Account fee remains unchanged at R105 per month, with no VAT increase.
The Premier Bundle account fee which has remained unchanged since 2014 increases from R199 to R209.
The Private Clients Bundle Monthly Account fees which had remained unchanged since 2016 increases from R365 to R385. According to FNB, the group’s new eWallet Xtra is a fully-fledged banking account – and with zero monthly fees, it has become the most affordable entry level bank account in the country.
