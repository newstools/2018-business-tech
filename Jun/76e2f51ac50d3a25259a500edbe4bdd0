Please Call Me inventor Nkosana Makate has reportedly reached an agreement with Vodacom, after the cellular company approached the court to apply for a gag order against him. According to a report by News24, Vodacom applied for the order to prohibit the spread of any information regarding settlement negotiations between them. In April, MyBroadband reported that Vodacom made an offer of R10 million to Makate, which was been described as a “pittance”, as it was said to be less than Makate’s legal fees for his decade-long battle with the operator. Makate’s disclosure of the R10 million offer was made in complaints he filed with the Independent Regulatory Board of Auditors and the Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission against Vodacom and its auditor PwC. As part of the order, Makate has reportedly undertaken not to disclose confidential issues as defined in the confidentiality agreement. He is also not allowed to discuss the content of the negotiations with any third parties – including the media. “The respondent will make no such disclosures save for those which, in terms of the confidentiality agreement, he is entitled to disclose,” the order further reads. The Constitutional Court ruled that Vodacom must pay the inventor in 2016, after he developed the Please Call Me product in November 2000.  The negotiations between Makate and Vodacom have been hampered by multiple factors, including infighting between Makate, his legal team, and his financial backers.
