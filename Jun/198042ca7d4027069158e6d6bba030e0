Limpopo’s provincial government is fond of German car manufacturers. This is according to a recent Q&A session, in which DA provincial leader Jacques Smalle posed questions about the cars purchased by the province’s various departments and Premier Stan Mathabatha’s office, reports the City Press. Notably, seven of the province’s eleven top politicians appear to favour the Mercedes brand, with taxpayers money also spent on a Jeep, a Lexus, a VW Touareg and a Range Rover. These vehicles also included a number of extras such as metallic paint, sun roofs, tinted windows and maintenance plans – with total costs exceeding R8 million. Some of the cars include: Jeep Grand Cherokee – R1.2 million
Range Rover Sport – R1.2 million
Mercedes-Benz ML 350 Blue Tec –  R941,513

Mercedes-Benz ML 400 – R740,848 Ministerial handbook The amount that South Africa’s politicians are allowed to spend on vehicles is currently regulated by a ministerial handbook. The handbook also provides for the amount of time/mileage a politician has to drive a vehicle before being allowed to purchase a new one. On Monday (4 June), TimesLive reported that Public service and administration minister Ayanda Dlodlo was expected to submit the final draft of a revised ministerial handbook to President Cyril Ramaphosa some in the next week. Government announced the review of the ministerial handbook in 2009 following public pressure after it emerged that ministers in the then Jacob Zuma administration had embarked on a shopping spree‚ buying luxurious vehicles shortly after assuming office. While Dlodlo did not say what perks she intended to cut, she acknowledged that the handbook was in need of reviewing and that her task-team was in the process of completing the report.
