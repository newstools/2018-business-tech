Construction on Sandton’s new R3 billion smart eco city, Sandton Gate, has begun, with co-developers Abland and Tiber Construction breaking ground on the first phase. According to Abland, the first phase of the development will see the construction of over 30,000 square metres of mixed-use space, including premium-grade office space, a residential block and amenities like a gym. The commercial and residential components will also be developed over this period. The Sandton Gate precinct is envisioned as an eco-friendly smart mini-city, that will serve as a commercial and residential hub within the greater Sandton area. It will be located on William Nicol Drive, in the middle of four commercial nodes, namely Sandton CBD, Bryanston, Randburg and Hyde Park. The commercial construction of the first phase is expected to be completed and launched for availability by the end of 2019. This is the node’s location and planned phases.
