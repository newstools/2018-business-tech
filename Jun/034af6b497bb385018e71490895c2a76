If you’ve ever wanted to spend a weekend in your own private castle, this unique listing on Airbnb for a stay at the Pezula Castle in Knysna might be just for you. The ‘Pezula Castle’ went on auction in January this year after being listed for sale for R56 million. The entire property is in fact made up of three “castles”, covering a total of 1,000 square metres – the Main Castle accounts for 656 square metres, with three en-suite bedrooms, with the Honeymoon Castle (190 square metres) and Little Castle (165 square metres) completing the build. All three are currently listed as rentable on Airbnb, from R6,200 a night for one of the smaller castles – to R110,000 a night for the main one (which is all-inclusive). The castles are all found on a pristine, secluded beach which lies in a hidden bay bordered by the Sinclair Nature Reserve on one side and the Pezula Private Estate on the other.  Pezula Private Castle – R110,000 per night (minimum of 2 nights) The R110,000 per night price tag may seem steep, but it is an all-inclusive offer which includes meals and beverages and a private butler. The castle accommodates 10 guests in 5 bedrooms and 5 full bathrooms.  Lindsay Castle – R6,325 per night (minimum varies) The castle accommodated 12 guests in 6 bedrooms, with 5 full bathrooms.
