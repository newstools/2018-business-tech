The Department of Higher Education and Training recently published a list of high-demand occupations in South Africa. The list – which is reviewed every two years – highlights over 370 occupations that show relatively strong employment growth and/or are experiencing shortages in the labour market or which are expected to be in demand in future. While management and other senior positions typically dominate the category of jobs most in demand, the list of occupations is wide-ranging, and includes everything from CFOs to chefs. As some of the jobs are also highly specialised, it may also be the case that some positions (such as certain types of senior sales managers) do typically earn more on average than other high paying positions (such as a marketing director ) which are typically positions seen in a number of companies. Notably a number of these jobs also top the R1 million mark when looking at salary data provided by Payscale and Indeed. BusinessTech looked at 9 of the jobs most in-demand – which also have the highest average annual salaries. Read: These jobs are in high demand in South Africa right now
