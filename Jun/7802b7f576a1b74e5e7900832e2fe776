On Wednesday South Africa saw another substantial petrol price increase, climbing by 82 cents a litre for both 93 and 95 octane fuel, while diesel was hiked by between 85 and 87 cents per litre. This took the official petrol price up to R15.54 for 93 octane, and R15.79 for 95 octane. While Diesel (0.05% sulphur content) costs you R14.19. While it is impossible to accurately track exactly how much petrol you will consume due to factors such as traffic and road quality, it is possible to get a rough estimate of how exactly these petrol prices will impact you current petrol allowance based on manufacturer estimates. BusinessTech looks at how much it will now cost you to travel 100km on South Africa’s roads based on Naamsa’s latest list of bestselling vehicles for May 2018. The prices for 95 and 93 petrol were used for comparison purposes, although the manufacturer may have a specific fuel recommendation.
