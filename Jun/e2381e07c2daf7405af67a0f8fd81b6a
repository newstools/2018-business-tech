LSM Group recently announced that you can expect to pay around R3.5 million for Lamborghini’s luxury Urus SUV in South Africa. The Urus has a 650-horsepower (478 kW), 4.0 litre V8 twin-turbo engine and gets 850 Nm of torque from a 4WD, eight-speed automatic transmission. It can hit 62 mph (100km/h) in 3.6 seconds and will continue accelerating all the way to 190 mph (305 km/h). The standard model has 21-inch rims and comes with adaptive air suspension and carbon ceramic brakes, as well as active roll stabilisation. It will be sold in two dealerships in Johannesburg and in Cape Town, while a third dealership in Durban is in the planning stages. In addition to its impressive specifications, the Urus’ price-tag also make it one of the most expensive SUVs currently available on the South African market.
