The Hawks have raided the offices of MTN and its law firm, Webber Wentzel, as part of an investigation related to the dispute between MTN and Turkcell. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi told Fin24 the raids happened on Friday, and that documents and equipment were seized at MTN and Webber Wentzel’s offices. Mulaudzi said the Hawks’ serious corruption investigation and the priority crime and specialised investigation units conducted the search and seizure operation on allegations of foreign bribery. “The purpose was to obtain documentation relating to the deal and further seize equipment linked to the matter. Investigations are still continuing,” said Mulaudzi. Webber Wentzel said in a statement that as a law firm, it is professionally prevented from providing any third party with information related to its clients’ matters. “We are reviewing the lawfulness of the warrant and its execution by the Hawks on various grounds, including legal privilege,” said Webber Wentzel. “We ensured that the documents and information taken were sealed and will be kept by an independent third party, nominated by us, pending the outcome of an application to the high court.” “We will ensure that our client’s rights are protected and that legal privilege, which is a key principle to our profession, is upheld.” Read: Turkcell pleased with progress in its R59 billion lawsuit against the MTN
