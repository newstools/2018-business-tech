A multifunctional home that has been used as the backdrop of many high profile productions and events has recently been listed with Seeff Centurion for just over R9 million. The home, located in Irene, is constructed of concrete, steel, wood and glass and has captured the imagination of architects, interior designers and bespoke property buyers from around the world. Steve van Wyk, Seeff’s MD in Centurion, said while the home has been the inspiration behind numerous articles in local as well as international publications, it still has a sound South African feel to it. The seven bedroom, six bathroom home is set on 4,163 sqm of land, with a building size of 566 sqm. “The design allows for deep sun during winter and a shaded environment during summer and negates the use of an artificially controlled environment. In addition the low slanted roof has an industrial origin with opening sections at the higher zone allowing for control of the internal environment. “Finishes throughout are basic and elemental and the floors are standard cement screeds with epoxy paint. The sanitary fittings, ironmongery and lighting are standard industrial off the shelf for which little or no maintenance is required,” noted van Wyk. He added that the home also has guesthouse and entertainment rights and flexible zoning. The space is a highly multi-functional environment ideal for living, working and entertaining. It includes two offices and can easily be converted to a guest house (each bedroom has its own living area) conference facility, function hall or two separate residential dwellings.
