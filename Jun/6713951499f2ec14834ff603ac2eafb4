Seacom says it has upgraded its key submarine network system from its Southern and Eastern African coastline landings into Europe at a total capacity of 1.5Tbps. The current upgrade is adding 500G of new capacity on the system, after a previous upgrade of 500G about 18 months ago, it said. The upgrade increases available capacity in the group’s key markets: Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and South Africa. “The solution will allow Seacom to deliver requirements for high capacity connectivity in very short timeframes and provide for future demands. The latest deployment is also based on 100Gbps Coherent DWDM technology, and will provide room for Seacom to quickly add more capacity as required, it said in a statement on Tuesday. The group also recently noted that it has doubled its enterprise customer base over the past year, which now exceeds 3,000 new customers across Kenya and South Africa. Seacom Business now delivers more than 150 new services across Africa each month, the group said. The company’s enterprise offerings include fibre Internet access, which ranges from 25Mbps to 1Gbps in speed – depending on the region. According to Seacom CEO Byron Clatterbuck, a major driver behind the division’s impressive growth was the establishment of new interconnect agreements with last-mile suppliers and securing wireless network access in areas without fibre. The group also recently acquired MacroLan, which strengthened its fibre Internet access business, it said. Seacom said it is currently looking at several other acquisitions, focussing on urban areas in South Africa and Kenya. Read: Seacom in high-speed fibre push for Joburg
