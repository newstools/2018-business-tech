Mustek, a JSE-listed assembler and distributor of personal computers and complementary ICT products, has officially been appointed as an Apple B2B partner for South Africa. This, the group said, is in line with its business strategy of expanding its product and service offering to the market. “An additional value add to our Apple portfolio is that Mustek is a DEP (device enrolment programme) reseller providing a faster and more streamlined way to deploy your corporate-owned Mac, Apple TV or iOS devices. Ready set deploy. Further benefits of DEP include zero-touch configuration for IT, streamlined setup and wireless supervision,” Mustek said. Mustek was originally appointed as an authorised Apple reseller for the South African market in August last year. In February Mustek reported only a marginal 1.5% rise in revenue to R2.65 billion for the six months ended December 2017, attributing the slowdown in growth to its decision to reduce its supply to retailers.
