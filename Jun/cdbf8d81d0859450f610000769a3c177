First National Bank (FNB) has announced a number of changes to its eBucks Rewards programme which celebrates a milestone of having paid out R10 billion to its members over the past 18-years. In a statement released on Friday (1 June), the bank said that the key changes would come into effect from 1 July 2018. “The bank continues to build a stronger value proposition for its customers through a range of competitive products and services that are tailored for the holistic needs of customers, offer meaningful rewards and the best value possible,” said Raj Makanjee, FNB Retail CEO. “Furthermore, our digital migration strategy continues to pay off as more customers benefit from the convenience, rewards and cost savings benefits of using these platforms.” The eBucks rewards changes include: The amount of points required has been reduced per reward level for Premier, Private Clients, Private Wealth and RMB Private bank accounts which makes it easier for members to move up reward levels.
