The Sunday Times has published its latest Generation Next youth survey, listing the brands South Africa’s youth deem as their favourites in over 75 different categories – including companies, banks, shopping malls, cars and fast-food restaurants. Now in its 14th year, the survey polls more than twelve thousand youths from around the country, across more than seventy categories, and is considered the leading barometer of what SA’s kids, teens and young adults find on-trend and aspirational. “The Sunday Times Generation Next survey is a great insight into how the youth perceive and attribute value to brands in a highly competitive market, said Reardon Sanderson, GM of Group Sales & Marketing at Tiso Blackstar. “It’s always important for brands to understand how a very switched-on youth segment makes decisions, as they’ll soon be the income-earners of tomorrow. “The results can have a strong impact on the tactics and longer term marketing strategies that brands put in place, and the Sunday Times recognises the very important role this survey plays for advertisers,” he said.
