Amazon Web Services’ content delivery system, CloudFront, has announced that it will be launching its first point of presence on the African continent in Johannesburg, with another to follow in Cape Town soon after. Since launching Amazon CloudFront in November 2008, it has been continuously expanding its  infrastructure footprint around the world to improve availability and performance for content delivery. It will now launch two new CloudFront Edge locations – one in Johannesburg, South Africa, and one in Bangalore, India. “We’re also happy to announce that Amazon CloudFront will be launching another Edge location in Cape Town in the coming weeks,” it said. The Edge location in Johannesburg is Amazon CloudFront’s first PoP on the African continent. The addition of these two locations brings CloudFront’s global network to 119 Points of Presence in 58 cities, across 26 countries. Amazon Web Services first established its presence in South Africa with a Development Center in Cape Town in 2004. Since then, it has expanded its presence in South Africa by launching Direct Connect in December 2017 and now the first CloudFront Edge location in Johannesburg. “Amazon CloudFront’s expansion into South Africa further improves availability and performance of content delivery to viewers in the region. We expect that customers who use Amazon CloudFront to reach viewers in South Africa will see performance improvements of as much as 75% from reduction in latency for their content delivery,” the group said. In addition to reducing latency, Edge locations bring the full suite of benefits provided by Amazon CloudFront such as Lambda@Edge, Field Level Encryption, and Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration, as well as seamless integration with other AWS services like AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), AWS Shield, AWS WAF, AWS Simple Storage Service (S3), and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). “Each of our new Edge locations are built to the same high standards as our other CloudFront Edge locations around the world, including infrastructure and processes that are all compliant with PCI, DSS, HIPAA, and ISO to ensure secure delivery of the most sensitive data,” Amazon said.
