Universum Global, an employer branding organisation, has published a list of South Africa’s Most Attractive Employers based on its extensive annual research. With over 45,000 university students and approximately 22,000 young professionals participating in the survey, Universum’s results cover key sectors and categories including business and commerce, technology and engineering, and natural sciences. The research generated a range of in-depth insights that shed light into how talent evaluates employer brands, what they find attractive in these employers, and ultimately, which employers are the most attractive in South Africa. “The insights have showed that while having high awareness levels is imperative for employer brands, those levels do not always translate to desire to work for an employer. “Despite the high unemployment levels talent is facing, they are reporting that being aware of an employer and their staffing needs is not enough to drive the desire to work for that employer,” said Universum’s Winani Ndlovu. “Employers need to clearly articulate their value proposition to assist them in making an informed decision before joining the organisation. Clearly having a strong employer brand is imperative for the attraction and retention of talent.” These include employer preferences, salary expectations, concerns relating to employment, goals, both short and long term, expectations around training and development, the importance of corporate culture, and much more.
