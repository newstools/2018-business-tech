South Africa’s GDP growth for 2018 is forecast to reach 1.7% according to a survey of 24 economists conducted by Reuters. Having grown by 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017, the country’s economy wobbled in the first quarter of 2018, shrinking by 2.2% quarter-on-quarter. Agriculture, mining and manufacturing were the main contributors to the slowdown, with the electricity, construction and trade industries also recording negative growth, said StatsSA. The 2.2% fall marked the largest quarter-on-quarter decline since the first quarter of 2009. In that quarter, the economy contracted by 6.1%. Economists and ratings agencies have cast down on the country’s ability to meaningfully grow the economy despite signs of improvement in governance following the appointment of Cyril Ramaphosa  as president of the nation. Concerns remain over the whigh unemployment rate, while a US-China trade war is having a meaningful impact on emerging market currencies, currently led by the rand, which has fallen to seven-month lows this week. “The rest of the world is doing very, very well, so on the export side of things we will actually start doing better,” Busisiwe Radebe, an economist at Nedbank told Reuters. “That is why you see that lift that we are expecting.” Miyelani Maluleke, an economist at Absa Capital, said domestic demand still had enough momentum to deliver GDP growth of 1.7% in 2018. “There were some one-off factors that contributed to the first-quarter GDP contraction and the effect of those will likely wear off,” Maluleke said. Citing Reserve Bank deputy governor Kuben Naidoo, Bloomberg reported that the rand’s plunge to the weakest in almost seven months against the dollar may push up South African inflation and require interest-rate increases.
