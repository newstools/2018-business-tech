Exclusive Books has appointed a new chief executive officer in Grattan Kirk, with effect from 1 August 2018. Kirk is currently employed at JSE-listed Tiger Brands, where he serves on the executive committee as chief growth officer: Grocery & Home, Personal Care & Baby. He was also formerly CEO of JD Group, the parent company of Incredible Connection and HiFi Corp. Kirk will take over from Benjamin Trisk who, according to BusinessDay, reached an  “amicable settlement” with the board following a breakdown in the relationship among shareholders. “The board and shareholders welcome Grattan, who is a qualified Chartered Accountant with 17 years retail experience. “We look forward to working with Grattan and benefitting from his significant experience, leadership skills and business growth track record. We thank Frank Boner, who will remain on as CFO of the Group, for the invaluable role he has played as interim CEO over the last few months,” Exclusive Books said in a statement. In 2013, Exclusive Books – and its sister company Van Schaik Bookstore – was sold by Times Media Group (TMG) to a private consortium led by Medu Capital for R435 million.
