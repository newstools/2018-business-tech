Currently standing at about 38%, South Africa’s high youth unemployment rate is holding younger generations back from the freedoms that come with financial security, further fueling societal issues of poverty and crime. This is according to Gary Epstein, MD at EasyBiz QuickBooks, who suggests that the development of skills required by the marketplace – from trades, to specialisations like engineering and medicine – should be a leading priority. “Certain skills, such as those in finance and accounting, can also be applied across a range of industries, thereby increasing opportunities for employment,” he said. “With President Cyril Ramaphosa committing to phasing in fully subsidised higher education and training for poor and working-class students in 2018, these are the skills we should be encouraging our youth to study. Otherwise we may be at risk of increasing the number of unemployed graduates in our society.” Epstein shares his insights into the top five careers that South African youth should be considering to achieve economic empowerment.
