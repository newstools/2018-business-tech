Prospective students who are interested in the University of Pretoria’s academic offerings can now take a virtual tour of the campuses from the comfort of their homes. The virtual campus is a media-rich mini-site that provides information to all students, including postgraduate and international students, as well as other members of the community who wish to know more about UP in terms of academic activities, research opportunities and collaborations. The site includes support programmes to help students graduate on time; free career guidance, work readiness and entrepreneurship training; additional online resources and a range of community engagement programmes to enrich students’ learning experiences and to encourage social responsibility. According to prof Stephanie Burton, vice-principal of research and postgraduate education, the aim of the virtual campus is to showcase the learning, teaching and research facilities of the university and to make the campus more accessible to a wider and more diverse group of prospective students. “This platform will allow people to access and experience UP with the click of a button from anywhere, at any time, affording them the opportunity to discover a world of academic excellence; and to explore new and diverse career path opportunities,” she said. “The platform will provide prospective students with a holistic experience and on-demand information.” There is also a text-only content version option for those students who have data and other accessibility constraints. Phase two of the virtual campus will feature information on postgraduate studies and the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS), in Illovo, Johannesburg, as well as additional media such as webinars and more videos.
