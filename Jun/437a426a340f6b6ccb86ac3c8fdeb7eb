Recent reports indicate that Toyota is expected to launch a ‘baby Fortuner’ in South Africa as soon as next month. A version of the Toyota Rush will be launched as a budget-conscious SUV locally, having already launched in Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also expected to launch in India and the UAE. No price has yet been released for the vehicle, however, Wheels24 noted that the Rush could be offered at around R280,000 to R300,000. This would make it a very competitively-priced option – in both the SUV and crossover segment which has grown increasingly popular with South African motorists. Below BusinessTech looked at the other SUV and crossover options currently available in this price range.
