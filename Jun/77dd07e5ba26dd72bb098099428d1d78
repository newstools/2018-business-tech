Liquid Telecom South Africa CEO Reshaad Sha has identified four pillars upon which the company bases its cloud services, and as a part of its digital transformation journey in South Africa. Sha, who recently took up the position of CEO at Liquid Telecom SA, provided insight into the company’s role in digital transformation at the 2018 MyBroadband Cloud Conference on Wednesday (13 June 2018). The chief executive said that the cloud is critical part of digital transformation. He said that the company builds its cloud service on four pillars which enables exceptional service delivery to users, and helps form the basis for a company or a country’s digital transformation journey. The first pillar is elasticity, as a service must be able to shift to the demands of a business. The second pillar is reliability, Sha said. The third pillar is security, and with Liquid Telecom’s highly-secure data centres and connectivity options – and its top-tier partners like Microsoft Azure – it offers secure services to customers, the chief executive said. The fourth pillar, he said,  is everywhere. Sha said thanks to their fibre network – the largest pan-African fibre network – they can offer services across multiple continents. These pillars are the glue that bring Liquid Telecom’s capabilities together, he said. He also emphasised that business owners and executives must develop their own view of what is required to digitally transform. “When you think about your journey into the cloud and think about your digital transformation initiative… develop your own view of your business, and develop your own lens to investigate what your business model is,” said Sha.
