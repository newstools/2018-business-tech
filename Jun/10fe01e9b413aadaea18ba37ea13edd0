In February, Google launched its ‘Android Enterprise Recommended’ programme – aimed at making it simple for businesses to confidently select Android devices that meet elevated enterprise requirements validated by Google. According to Google, the programme will ensure devices are up to date with regular security patches delivered within 90 days, and are also guaranteed to get at least one additional major OS update. Other considerations made by Google in selecting the devices include minimum hardware specifications, bulk enrolment and user experience. At launch, this list featured just 21 smartphones – many of which are not available in the South African market. That list has since expanded significantly, and now includes additional options to select phones based on requirements such as screen size, OS version, and RAM size. It has also expanded its list to include phones that are ‘ruggedised‘ for those who do more work outdoors, as well as a ‘zero-touch’ phones which promise seamless setup and deployment. BusinessTech looked at 7 of these phones and how much they cost in South Africa. You can find the full list of recommended phones here. Specifications may differ slightly by country.
