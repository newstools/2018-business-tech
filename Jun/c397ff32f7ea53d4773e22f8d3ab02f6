The fast food and quick service restaurant (QSR) sector continues to grow despite tough economic times. This is according to Andre Beck, sector head of Fast Food and Restaurants at FNB Business, who notes that with a contribution in excess of 29%, QSR has by far the biggest share in franchising turnover. “Industry data shows that South Africa has seen more franchises opening fast food and restaurant outlets in spite of the floundering economy,” he said. “This clearly paints a picture of a sector that is competitive and lucrative, and more importantly, it shows that the franchising has sustained appetite to grow further in the local economy.” While a number of franchises still require significant start-up capital to open, there are a number of options for those looking to buy for less than R2 million. BusinessTech looked at 14 of the most well-known ones below. Domino’s Pizza – from R2 million  Domino’s pioneered the pizza delivery business, and sells more than one million pizzas daily worldwide. It currently has almost 11,000 stores in over 70 markets around the world. In South Africa, that number has grown to 50 in Guateng and the Western Cape. This franchise has a caveat as currently Domino’s Pizza in South Africa is primarily an internally-based franchise organisation. This means that those interested in franchising should contact the Franchise Development Team, who will contact you if an opportunity becomes available.
