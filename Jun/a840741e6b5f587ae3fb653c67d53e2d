Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe has again been heavily implicated in Gupta-linked activity, with a new report saying he and three other executives should be held liable for R15.4 billion worth of dodgy dealings at Transnet. According to the City Press, a new draft report from Mncedisi Ndlovu & Sedumedi (MNS) Attorneys has fingered former Transnet CEO, Molefe, former CFO Anoj Singh, Transnet board subcommittee chairperson Iqbal Sharma, and Gupta lieutenant Salim Essa, as the key players behind a locomotive contract that ballooned from R38.6 billion to R54 billion. The contract was for more than a thousand locomotives, but the attorneys could not find any justifiable reason why the contract cost R15.4 billion more, calling it “inexplicable, unreasonable and excessive”. The draft report recommended that Molefe and the other executives face criminal charges for fraud and corruption, and that board should try and recoup money from Molefe in particular, as it was his actions as CEO that led to the problems. The new report echoes findings from law firm Werksmans, which last month also found that Molefe and Singh had allegedly helped inflate the contracts. Molefe and Singh’s names have popped up in various investigations and reports into state capture. Singh, who is also the former CFO for Eskom, was suspended by the power utility in September 2017, after being placed on special leave at the end of July. He was allegedly involved in irregularly awarding contracts to Gupta-linked businesses, and also reportedly received gifts and trips from the controversial family.
