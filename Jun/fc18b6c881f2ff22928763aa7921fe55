Netflix is the streaming service of choice according the MyBroadband’s latest survey, The 2018 DStv and Netflix Survey was taken by 9,857 MyBroadband readers and forum members. 65% of respondents stated that they were subscribed to service, while 38% of respondents said that they subscribed to ShowMax, and 12% of respondents said that they subscribed to Amazon Prime Video. Of these Netflix subscribers, 41% respondents stating that they are currently subscribed to the Premium package, while 42% of respondents said that they were on the Standard package. The Netflix Premium package costs $11.99 per month (R153.44) and lets users watch on four devices at the same time – all in UHD. In comparison, the Standard package costs $9.99 (R127.85) per month, goes up to HD resolution, and can can be used on two devices at the same time. There’s no doubt that the service continues to offer tremendous value for money, with a recent survey by asset management firm Piper Jaffray, finding that 65% of subscribers would not cancel their subscription until the company raised prices past $15 (R191) a month. However, South Africans already pay slightly less than some of their international counterparts, as it was unaffected by an October 2017 price hike which saw the standard service increase to $10.99 (R140.59), and the premium service increase to $13.99 (R178.96). In response to questions on whether South African Netflix users can expect this price gap to close, manager for Netflix Corporate Communications EMEA, Yann Lafargue, explained that South Africa was not necessarily unique in avoiding these price increases. “There were no pricing increases for all the new markets (which includes South Africa) that were launched in January 2016,” he explained. “What you can see is some regional differences but overall pricing is fairly consistent. We have no plans to increase prices for now,” he added.
