FNB has published its new banking fees for the 2018/19 period – the last of the major retail banks to make adjustments for this year. While the bank has kept some of its prices unchanged – such as the monthly fee for its popular Gold Account – other prices have been hiked in line with inflation, and include the adjustments for the recent VAT rise. From 1 April 2018, the VAT rate was hiked to 15%, which translated to a 1% increase in fees across most of the country’s banks – though some of these costs have been absorbed by the banks. The tables below show how fees for South Africa’s five major retail banks have changed, year-on-year, taking into account the change in VAT. The accounts used are the respective banks’ mid-market accounts. The calculations are based on a R500 transaction, which the banks have said is the most common range for cash-based transactions in the country. Absa, Standard Bank, Nedbank and Capitec’s rates (adjusted for VAT) have been in effect since 1 April 2018, with FNB’s new rates kicking in from 1 July 2018.
