Toyota is expected to launch what car specialists are calling a ‘baby Fortuner’ in South Africa, next month. A version of the Toyota Rush will be launched as a budget-conscious SUV locally, having already launched in Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also expected to launch in India and the UAE. According to cars.co.za, the Rush will fill the role of the Daihatsu Terios – discontinued from the local market in 2015 – and a brand that belongs in the Toyota stable. The Rush contains a 77 kW/137 Nm 1.5-litre petrol engine, which is paired with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. No price has yet been released for the vehicle, however, Wheels24 noted that the Rush could be offered at around R280,000 to R300,000.
