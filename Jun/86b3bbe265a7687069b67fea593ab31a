The Department of Energy has launched a new mobile app that allows consumers to make in-store energy comparisons of different appliance models before buying them. The Appliance Energy Calculator mobile app allows for consumers to enter the relevant information (easily sourced from the mandatory energy label on the appliance) into the app, which calculates the estimated running cost of the appliances of their choice, the department said in a statement on Friday (8 June). It added that the app shows how much powers the appliance uses over a one and ten year period, and also estimates CO2 emissions of the appliance. The launch of the app also accompanies a Standards and Labelling (S&L) programme, which aims to places energy labels on appliances that provide consumers with accurate and comparable information on their energy efficiency. Appliances for which the display and use of the South African Energy Efficiency Label is compulsory include: Washer-Dryer Combinations
Washing Machines
Tumble Dryers
Electric Ovens
Fridge-Freezer Combinations
Freezers
Electric Water Heaters (geysers)
Fridges
Dishwashers and
Air-Conditioners TV and audio-visual equipment including decoders and set-top boxes do not need to display a label but must have a standby power usage of less than 1 Watt, and 3 Watts for set top boxes. “Access to electricity for all South Africans remains a core objective of government and so is the efficient and effective use of this resource,” said energy minister Jeff Radebe. “Because we cannot always control how citizens choose to use their electricity, it was imperative for us to implement measures that ensure that appliances sold in South Africa are regulated and energy efficient. We equally introduced instruments that assist consumers to make the right choices when purchasing appliances.” The Appliance Energy Calculator app is currently available on the Google Playstore and Apple app store, the department said.
