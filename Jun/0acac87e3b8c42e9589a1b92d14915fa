The University of Johannesburg has announced that it will be launching four new online-only courses on top of the four master’s degree programmes it launched in 2017. Towards the end of 2017, UJ launched four online-only master’s degree programmes – a first-of-its-kind for South Africa – with the university now adding two bachelor degree courses and two advanced diploma courses to its portfolio. The master’s degree courses launched last year are: Master of Public Health;
Master of Public Management and Governance;
Master of Education Management; and
Master of Education in Information and Communication Technology. The four new additional online programmes are: Bachelor of Commerce in International Accounting
Bachelor of Human Resource Management
Advanced Diploma in Financial Markets and
Advanced Diploma in Transportation Management. According to the university, the master’s courses attracted widespread interest, and filled up within days after launching. “These Master’s programmes have successfully run over the last four intakes – growing in student enrolments and pass rates with each module completed,” it said. “For the fifth intake, on 2 July, UJ launches its second batch of 100% online only programmes to complement UJ’s suite.” All four of the new courses reside in the UJ College of Business and Economics (CBE) and enable online students to collaborate with peers and lecturers, internationally, the university said. By offering these 100% online programmes, UJ said it provides an alternative means of acquiring internationally renowned qualifications available to students who are not able to attend face-to-face lectures. “By going online, UJ is offering learning opportunities that accommodates logistical challenges such as full-time employment, geographical location, family obligations, and a host of other challenges that our modern student body faces.” Read: Only one South African university climbed the latest global rankings
