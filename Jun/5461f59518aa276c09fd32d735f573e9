A new Netflix job posting indicates that the popular streaming service is looking to acquire more content from the Middle East, Turkey and Africa. According to the posting, the director of content acquisition job (which is based in Amsterdam), will be tasked with developing and executing strategy for acquiring global rights to desirable TV and film programming, sourced from outside the major studios. The director will also be responsible for ‘utilising existing relationships with local and regional distributors to enable successful licensing of local content’, and ‘building content pipeline around specific genres and verticals, such as local drama and local stand-up comedy’, the posting said. According to an analysis by Quartz, Netflix’s acquired content is likely to skew toward Anglophone programming because South Africa and Nigeria have the most sophisticated and largest industries, respectively. This makes it easier to pick up quality content, but it likely underweights about the good portion of the continent’s viewers who speak French and Portuguese, it said. South Africa Speaking to MyBroadband in October 2017, Yann Lafargue head of Netflix corporate communications for EMEA, said that the company was definitely interested in bringing South African movies and shows to a global audience through its platform. However he indicated that Netflix was not looking for content that will only appeal to a local audience, and as with shows like Narcos, they wanted local stories that may travel globally. One of the ways Netflix finds such content is through its content acquisition team, which scouts for places where there are good storytellers, he said. In May, the company added comedy ‘Catching Feelings’ to its catalogue, making it the first South African movie to appear locally on the streaming service.
