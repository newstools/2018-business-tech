The Democratic Alliance (DA) recently posted on its Twitter page that the Western Cape has created 75% of all jobs in South Africa in the past year. The political party’s claim has been backed up and confirmed by fact-checking group, Africa Check, which showed that the claim is based on Statistics South Africa’s (Stats SA) Quarterly Labour Force Survey for January to March 2018. “In the Western Cape, there were 123,000 more jobs in the first quarter of 2018 than there had been in the first quarter of 2017. This is 75% of the estimated 165,000 new jobs recorded for the whole country,” Africa Check said. “The balance of new jobs were in five other provinces. There were an estimated 83,000 jobs created in Limpopo, 62,000 in KwaZulu-Natal, 48,000 in the Free State, 22,000 in the Northern Cape and 16,000 in North West,” it said.
