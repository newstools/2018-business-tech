South African mobile group MTN says that it is planning to launch services in Namibia this August, Reuters reports. In an interview with the media group, MTN Namibia executive Hester Marais said that the operator will use Namibia’s state-owned network for its services, with further plans to also enter the local money market. MTN has had operations in Namibia for over 20 years, but only as an internet service provider to businesses. Currently Nambia only has two mobile operators, both state-owned – namely, TN Mobile and MTC. The country has a population of about 2.5 million people. The move will extend MTN’s reach in Africa, where it already has operations in major markets like Nigeria, Uganda and Ghana. Nigeria is the group’s biggest market, followed by Iran, and South Africa.
