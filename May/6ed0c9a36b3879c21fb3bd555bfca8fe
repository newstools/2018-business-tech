Comsol Networks has announced a collaboration with global technology giants Verizon and Samsung, to launch 5G fixed wireless trials in South Africa. The collaboration is aimed at delivering a wireless solution that rivals ‘FTTx’ offerings, including Fibre-to-the-Business and Fibre-to-the-Home, by early-2019. This will be achieved by using the ‘pre-5G’ proprietary standard from Verizon’s 5G Technical Forum (5GTF), which will ultimately be converted into the 5G New Radio (5GNR) standards once they have been confirmed, Comsol said in a statement on Wednesday (16 May). “In early trials in the US, Verizon has shown the potential of the 28GHz millimetre spectrum, which has been identified for 5G services by the country’s Federal Communications Commission,” said Comsol CEO Iain Stevenson. “With our access to the lion’s share of the 28Ghz band in South Africa, we’re excited to work together and accelerate the development of the 5G ecosystem. Verizon and Samsung’s involvement is a fantastic endorsement of our capabilities in the local market.” Stevenson added that 5G fixed wireless access holds the promise of connecting millions of South Africans with high-speed connectivity that would never be possible with fibre solutions (which require significant physical investment). “While this agreement initially focuses on 5G fixed wireless access, over time this will evolve into consumer offerings, similar to the way that we use 4G services today.” Read: Icasa wants to block networks from automatically charging out-of-bundle rates when you run out of data
