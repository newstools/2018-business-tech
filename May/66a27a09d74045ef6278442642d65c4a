Some restaurants on Uber Eats will be doubling up and give customers two meals for the price of one from Monday, 28 May, until Friday, 1 June. “Over the last six months, Uber Eats has given Eaters across South Africa 50% more restaurants with wider variety of options, while Eaters have ordered 50% more of the time. Now Uber Eats is saying thank to its Eaters by giving them two meals for the price of one from selective restaurants for five days only,” Uber Eats said in a statement on Thursday. As an example, it said that KFC nationwide will have its best seller – the 9 piece bucket + 4 free wings – on offer. Cape Town based restaurants, Junior and Jazzy’s Gourmet Pizzas will also be joining but offering 2-for-1 on their Cheeseburger and fries and Jazzy’s with their famous New Yorker pizza. And in Joburg, Topo Gigio’s will offer its Bolognaise Spaghetti (regular size), while Tei Avon Schwarma Bistro will list its Tei Avon burger. “These are just some of the great deals on offer, Eaters will be able to open their app on Friday to see their local offerings,” Uber Eats said. From the 25 May 2018, Uber Eats will be available in Johannesburg South. Read: You can now tip your Uber and UberEATs drivers through the app
