WPP and Kantar Millward Brown have released their annual BrandZ Top 100 most valuable global brands ranking for 2018. The ranking is based on the dollar amount a brand contributed to the overall value of a corporation, and is based on interviews with over three million consumers about thousands of brands, with rigorous analysis of the financial and business performance of each company (using data from Bloomberg and Kantar Worldpanel). The BrandZ rankings are the only brand valuations in the world that take into account what people think about the brands they buy. Eight out of the Top 10 are technology or tech-related brands. This category continues to dominate the rankings with Google and Apple retaining the number 1 and 2 spots, growing +23% to $302.1 billion and +28% to $300.6 billion respectively. Amazon moved into the no.3 position ahead of Microsoft, growing +49% to $207.6 billion, while Tencent rose ahead of Facebook (no.6) growing +65% in brand value to $179 billion, up three places from last year’s ranking.
