MTN has officially introduced a range of social bundles starting from as little as R1 a day, providing customers with affordable access to social media platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Customers can use the social bundle data allocation without impacting their regular in-bundle data. The bundles on offer cover daily, weekly and monthly, expiry rates. “There’s been a marked increase in the consumption of social media and data services so these social bundles are designed to meet those changing customer needs. By offering a variety of expiry periods, we put the control in the hands of our customers, so they can choose to buy just for the day or to stay connected for a week or a month,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, executive for corporate affairs: MTN South Africa. The social bundles are available on the MyMTN app or via USSD.  Read: MTN launches 1GB for R10 data bundles for WhatsApp and Twitter
