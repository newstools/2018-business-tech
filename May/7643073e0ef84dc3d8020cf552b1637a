Abacus Development and Nedbank CIB are launching a new luxury apartment development – 169 on Main – in Mouille Point, Cape Town. The 11 storey building will comprise 50 apartments, with prices ranging from R3.65 million to R15.75 million, all with luxury finishing. It will have a 24-hour concierge, security access control, private basement parking, full fibre connectivity, and a rooftop swimming pool. Construction on the building officially started in February 2018, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019, carrying a total value of over R200 million. While available apartments for sale average around R5 million, cheaper (R3.65m) 1-bedroom apartments have were on sale for less – though these are already sold out. 169 on Main forms part of a new wave of buildings going up around the city, leveraging the growing demand for apartment-style living.
