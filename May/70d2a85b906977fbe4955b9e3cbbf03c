Curro Holdings, the JSE-listed independent education provider, has acquired Dot’s Learning Centre – a learning support centre that offers small group classes for learners who do not cope in the mainstream schooling environment. Dot’s Learning Centre has relocated from its previous building in Bellville, Cape Town, to Curro premises in Durbanville. Dorothy Nortje, who founded the Centre in 2012, will continue to head up the Centre, while helping Curro Holdings further develop their learner support centre offering. The new premises officially opened its doors in April 2018. Dot’s Learning Centre strives to provide individualised support and attention to learners who find it difficult to develop fully in a mainstream learning environment. Through smaller, more manageable classes, the Centre is learner-centric, making the individual the focal point of teaching practices. Dot’s Learning Centre is a registered Independent Combined School and teaches a Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS) aligned program for learners from grade 1 to grade 12. CEO of Curro Holdings, Andries Greyling, notes the company’s decision to acquire Dot’s Learning Centre rested on a demand in the education space. Dot’s Learning Centre is registered as an examination centre for matriculants through the South African Comprehensive Assessment Institute (SACAI). As in the past, it will continue to assist home schoolers with the CAPS curriculum, and support remediation lessons with qualified specialists. Read: Curro revenue soars as learners exceed 52,000
