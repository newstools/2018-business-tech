Isuzu officially released its mu-X in South Africa this week – its first SUV competitor in over a decade. Although new to South Africa, it is already a well-established contender in several international markets, having been launched in Thailand in 2013. It is also currently sold in Australia as well as the Philippines, where it is the market leader. Based on its price range and features, the mu-X is likely to act in direct competition with long-time South African favourites including the Toyota Fortuner and Ford Everest. Starting at R568,000 for the 4×2 variant and R629,100 for the 4×4 variant, Isuzu’s MU-X debuts as a more expensive option than both the cheapest Fortuner (R454,500) and the cheapest Everest (R467,100). However the new car boasts impressive specs, including a 3.0 litre turbo diesel engine that produces 430Nm of torque, terrain command 4×4 system supported by a 5-link rear suspension, and a luxury seven-seat interior. Two models are available with the choice of 4×2 or 4×4 derivatives. The four-wheel drive version relies on Isuzu’s easy to use Terrain Command 4×4 system with electronically selected two and four-wheel drive high-range modes, or 4×4 low-range for more challenging off-road driving. The result is a car that Isuzu says will allow it to completely direct with the big players in the current Souh African SUV segment. “The launch of the mu-X is an important milestone for Isuzu Motors South Africa, as it expands our current product portfolio into the sport utility vehicle category, which is one of the fastest growing sectors in the automotive industry, both globally and in the domestic market,” said Dominic Rimmer, executive of technical services at Isuzu South Africa. “Building on Isuzu’s long-standing heritage, along with the proven reliability and trusted capabilities of the KB, the mu-X introduces an entirely new level of practicality, comfort and convenience that is ideally suited to the adventurous and lifestyle-oriented nature of South African customers,” Rimmer said.
