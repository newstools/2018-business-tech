KwaZulu Natal has at least 15 new major developments in the pipeline to boost tourism in the region, according to Tourism Updates, which will carry development costs of up to R39 billion. Accounting for the biggest portion of this total (as much as R35 billion) is the Durban Point precinct development, which aims to completely transform Durban’s prime beachfront property into a massive mixed-use waterfront. The final build will include hotels, residential apartments, office parks and retail developments – and will also see a new cruise ship terminal (valued at R215 million) constructed nearby. The project his already underway, through a R300 million promenade development, though the precinct is only expected to be completed after 2022. Among the list of developments highlighted by Tourism Updates, sourced from the recent World Travel Market Africa trade show, are a large number of resorts, hotels and lodges that are expected to be built in around KZN’s tourist hotspots. One of the stand-out projects, however, is the so-called “Durban Eye”, which is a planned R375 million Ferris wheel, which will mimic similar ‘observation’ wheels found around the world – such as the London Eye. According to Tourism Updates, the Durban Eye will consist of 27 fully enclosed air-conditioned cabins that each hold 16 passengers, and will take passengers 78 metres above the ground on a 15- to 20-minute four-revolution ride. While information is scarce, various sites have reportedly been identified including the Durban Point precinct, uShaka Marine, and Moses Mabhida, among others.
