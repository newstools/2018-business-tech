A number of senior leaders in the Democratic Alliance (DA) are planning a breakaway “true liberal party” in time for next year’s elections, City Press reported. The paper reported that ‘at least five’ senior figures within the party are unhappy with the leadership of Mmusi Maimane, and have been ‘holding consultations’, with current Western Cape Premier Helen Zille’s name at the top of the list to lead the new party. City Press said it that the political party is facing serious tensions over race, transformation and other policy positions, while a split would threaten its support base. The ANC, under president Cyril Ramaphosa, has once again become a popular option for voters. Research company Ipsos recently noted that the DA is currently polling at about 20% nationally, down from the 22.2% in the 2014 general elections. City Press said that senior leaders have spoken to the SA Institute of Race Relations on how to form a new party. A senior DA leader told City Press: “There is a group of hardcore DA leaders who feel that the DA is no longer truly liberal – and something is being done about it.” DA MP Phumzile van Damme said that talks of a new party was common around election time. “It never, ever takes off and I don’t think they would do well. “We haven’t heard any definitive announcements of a true liberal party being started,” Van Damme said.
