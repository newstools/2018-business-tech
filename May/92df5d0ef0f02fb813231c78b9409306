The UK’s Sunday Times Rich List for 2018 shows that the country’s wealthiest 1,000 people saw their combined fortune rise to £724 billion, up 10% from a record £658 billion in 2017. The paper noted that as many as 94% of the 1,000 wealthiest people built their own fortunes. Inherited wealth and old money have been all but banished from the 30th annual list. There are a total of 145 billionaires — also a record and 11 more than in 2017 — born, based or with substantial assets on these shores. The list covers individuals and families in the country, including many businessmen and women who have dual citizenship (through business, investments or residency). Nine South African born individuals appear on the list, including Nicky Oppenheimer and Nathan Kirsh who regularly feature on the Forbes wealth list. Also on the list is tech entrepreneur Mark Shuttlerworth, who is domiciled on the Isle of Man and who recorded a whopping £340 million increase over the past year. Jim Ratcliffe, who founded chemical firm Ineos, topped the list with an estimated fortune of £21.05 billion. He is followed by brothers, Sri and Gopi, worth £20.64 billion, while media mogul Sir Len Blavatnik is third with a fortune of £15.26 billion. “This year’s biggest risers include Sir James Dyson, whose technology business has been boosted by exports and a suite of new products. The inventor’s fortune is put at £9.5 billion, a rise of £1.7 billion in a year,” The Sunday Times said.
