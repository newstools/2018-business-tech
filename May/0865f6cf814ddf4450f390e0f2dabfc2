Sports and luxury vehicles remain one of the most popular purchases for High Networth Individuals (HNWIs) in South Africa. This is according to New World Wealth’s latest South African Wealth Report, which found that South Africa’s HNWIs currently favour luxury SUV’s because of the space they offer as well as their security features. However the country’s ultra-rich are still buying sports cars according to the report, with Porsche the most popular brand when it comes to revenue earned in South Africa, followed by Ferrari and Bentley. With the cheapest Porsche coming in at just under R900,000 (R870,000 for the Porsche 718 Cayman) its clear that many of these high-end vehicles are exclusive to the super-rich, however there are still a number of options for South Africans who don’t have several million rand to drop on a high-end sports car.
