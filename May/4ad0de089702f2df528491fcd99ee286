JSE-listed ICT group Jasco says that after seven years at the helm of the group, current chief executive officer Pete da Silva will step down to take up the position as a non-executive director on the board. It follows the successful restructuring process in line with the board’s objectives, Jasco said. Current chief operating officer, Mark van Vuuren, will be appointed as CEO with effect from 1 July 2018. “Succession planning has been in place over the last few years to ensure leadership continuity within the senior management team. Mark has worked closely with Pete in preparation over the last 18 months. He has been with Jasco for the last ten years, firstly as
managing director of Jasco ICT Solutions and then as COO since late 2013. Mark has also been on the group’s executive committee since 2012. “As part of management development, Mark has attended the Jasco Board meetings by invitation over the last 18 months,” Jasco said in a statement. Prior to Jasco, van Vuuren was the COO at Nokia Siemens Networks and also founded his own company in the ICT industry. Dr Anna Mokgokong, chairman of the board, said: “Pete and his executive team has addressed a number of challenges during his time as CEO and successfully implemented the group’s turnaround strategy against tough market conditions. He leaves Jasco with a stable and diversified team at executive level which is ready for future growth. We thank him for his contribution and inspiring leadership during his time as CEO and look forward to his future contribution as a Non-Executive Director. ” Read: Jasco launches new affordable fibre network monitoring service
