With Renault and Hyundai both announcing this week that they will be bringing new hatchbacks to the local market, its clear that competition in the segment is heating up. Redesigns of Hyundai’s i20 and Renault’s Sandero Stepway also point towards a growing move towards ‘crossover’ type vehicles, with their new looks taking major inspiration from the aesthetics of SUVs, while maintaining a relatively budget price-point. While both cars are likely to be popular, they will face stiff opposition from Volkswagen, which has shown that it plans to continue to dominate with the Volkswagen Polo and Polo Vivo, which remain the two bestselling passenger vehicles for April 2018. Hatchbacks have consistently proven to be some of the most popular cars in South Africa, primarily due to their relatively lower price point and fuel efficiency. With new data showing that South African consumers have moved back to buying new cars – and another massive petrol price hike expected for June 2018 – it’s likely many will turn to hatchbacks when looking for their next vehicle.
