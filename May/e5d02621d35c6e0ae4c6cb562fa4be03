Nissan has confirmed that it’s new Micra will be heading to South African shores in June. In a statement released on Thursday (10 May), Nissan said that the car will be a ‘Micra’ in name alone and will be a departure from what South Africans expect from typical hatchbacks. “Powered by an energetic turbo-charged 66kW engine, the sophisticated new Nissan Micra is set to make its mark in the Upper B hatchback segment while the Micra Active, which was launched last year, will remain as Nissan’s offering in the Lower B hatchback segment” it said. “The new Micra matches your individuality with an impressive specification list that features everything from a modern infotainment system that includes Apple CarPlay to comprehensive safety features in the form of six airbags, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic brake force distribution (EBD)”. More details, including pricing, will be released closer to the launch in June, Nissan said. However, it confirmed that the vehicle will be sold with a 3-year/90,000km service plan, a 6-year/150,000km warranty and 24-hour roadside assist.
