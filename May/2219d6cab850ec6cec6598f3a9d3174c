The Airports Company of South Africa has called for public comments on plans to rename four of the country’s airports. In a statement released on Wednesday (30 May), the company said that Cape Town International Airport, East London Airport, Port Elizabeth International Airport, and Kimberley Airport were all subject to renaming as part of the Transformation of Heritage Landscape government programme. It added that the proposed renaming will be implemented in terms of the South African Geographical Name Council Act, and that the process was therefore open to public comment until 6 June 2018. The announcement follows a number of proposed changes for South Africa’s airports, including calls for Cape Town International to be named after struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, following her death earlier this year. However the proposed change has also been met with some opposition with Janine Myburgh, president of the Cape Chamber of Commerce, stating that Cape Town was an international destination and needed a name that enjoyed international recognition. “We understand the political pressure for a new name, but it is likely to be controversial and that will mean another distracting problem, as well as the costs of all the new signs and rebranding,” she said to IOL. “Cape Town Airport is a politically neutral name that enjoys worldwide acceptance. It is an established brand and we should build on it rather than start all over again with a new name.” Read: Kenya Airways CEO open to SAA partnership
