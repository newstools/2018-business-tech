The latest PayProp Rental Index shows that the average percentage of South African tenants’ net income that they spend on rent increases disproportionally as their income increases. “Our assumption is that people who earn more can afford higher rents, but this doesn’t always seem to be the case,” says Johette Smuts from PayProp. “When we look at the change in debt-to-income ratios from Q4 2016 to Q4 2017, we see that these ratios increased for tenants who pay more than R10,000 rent. This means that tenants in this bracket are essentially living beyond their means while trying to keep up with the proverbial Joneses,” Smuts said. Average debt-to-income ratios for different rental brackets for Q4 2017  When considering the average income per rent bracket, Smuts said that, as expected, tenants who rent more expensive properties have higher incomes. Average credit measures tell a similar story – tenants who rent for more and have higher incomes also have better credit scores and lower debt-to-income ratios.
