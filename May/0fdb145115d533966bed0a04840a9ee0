Uber Eats has acquired South African-led tech group OrderTalk for an undisclosed sum, as it bids to better manage point-of-sale (POS) interactions between customer orders and partner restaurants. OrderTalk, is a Dallas-based restaurant technology company which specialises in point of sale (POS) integrations, which Uber Eats said will help its current systems reduce errors and better manage orders coming from clients. The group was originally headquartered in Cape Town, has a South African CEO, and had significant shareholding from Knife Capital – a Cape Town-based venture capital firm with ties to South African billionaire, Mark Shuttleworth. Uber Eats head of business development, Liz Meyerdirk, said that the company has a two-fold strategy behind its interest in POS integrations. One, she said, restaurants are asking for ways to reduce errors, such as those that could occur when an employee manually enters orders into the restaurant’s system. And two, the technical integrations would better manage restaurant workflow. “Instead of requiring a middleman, orders are quickly fed to the kitchen display monitor or ticketing system,” she said. According to Meyerdirk, OrderTalk has shown consistent growth over the past decade, seeing revenue jump 60 times since its initial round of  venture capital investment. The company has also grown form just 5 employees to 27. OrderTalk was founded by Hilton Keats in 1998, before being taken over by current CEO, Patrick Eldon in 2004. Eldon headquartered the company in Cape Town until its client base expanded in the US market. Shutleworth’s HBD Venture Capital, managed by Knife Capital, injected R9 million in to the business in 2008 to help the business expand internationally.
