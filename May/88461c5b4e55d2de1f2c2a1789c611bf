Data analytics group Lightstone has released a new report on the suburbs and homes you can afford to live in – based on your salary. According to Standard Bank’s latest house price index stand-alone properties have continued to outperform townhouses and flats in 2018, with the price of the median free-standing home climbing 7.6% year-on-year in April, versus 6.9% year-on-year in March to R1,049,200. By contrast, house price growth for flats and townhouses remained relatively flat at 5.8% year-on-year in April, with a median price of R874,700. Based on Lightstone’s data, this means you should be earning in the region of R35,000 to R39,000 a month to afford the average R1 million free-standing home in South Africa right now, and if you were looking to buy a R874,000 townhouse you should be earning in the region of R26,000 – R30,000. The table below shows how much you could spend on a home based on your monthly salary – as well as examples of suburbs with these median house prices. The data is based on current house prices (May 2018), factoring in the recent rate cut, and assumes a 0% deposit (but excludes additional fees incurred during the inception of the loan or transfer of property into the calculation.) Pricing is based on: The assumption that people are not going to spend more than 30% on servicing a home loan.
The assumption of a 0% deposit for both home financing (but excluding added additional fees incurred during the inception of the loan or transfer of property into the calculation).
The assumption that the homes are financed over 20 years at the prime lending rate. Read: How much it costs to move into a retirement home in South Africa
