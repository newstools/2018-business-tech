South Africa has almost 2,000 shopping malls, covering over 24 million square metres of shopping space, making it one of the most mall-rich countries in the world. According to the latest data from commercial real estate group, CBRE, South Africa ranks 46th in the world for its spread of retail space. Only two cities, Cape Town and Johannesburg, are ranked among the top cities in the world, with the latter ranked highest, at 98th overall. Being the economic hub of South Africa, the greater Johannesburg area (including Sandton, Midrand and extending to Pretoria) features the biggest concentration of retail space in the country. Gauteng has over 10.8 million square metres of retail space – which is bigger than the Western Cape (3.5 million sqm), KwaZulu-Natal (3.3 million sqm) and the Free State (870,000 sqm), combined. The largest shopping area in Johannesburg is the Sandton Retail Node (170,939 sqm), which consists of a combination of Sandton City (141,390 sqm), Nelson Mandela Square (16,265 sqm), Legacy Corner (7,000 sqm) and Michelangelo Towers Mall (6,284 sqm). Pretoria, meanwhile, is home to the recently renovated Menlyn Park Shopping Centre (177,000 sqm), Centurion Mall (112,828 sqm) and others. The City of Cape Town is home to Canal Walk (146,828 sqm), one of South Africa’s largest shopping centres, and the world-renowned Victoria Wharf (V&A) Shopping Centre. Both of these centres are attractive locations for international brands, CBRE said. For KwaZulu-Natal, the biggest retail node is in Durban – the Gateway Theatre of Shopping (150,320 sqm), followed by The Pavilion (119,000 sqm) and Galleria Shopping Centre (88,346 sqm). Compared to the other major provinces, the Free State has a limited offering of prime shopping destinations; the largest two centres are located in Bloemfontein. These are Loch Logan Waterfront (80,000 sqm) and Mimosa Mall (36,858 sqm).
