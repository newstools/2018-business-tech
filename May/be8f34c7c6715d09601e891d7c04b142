Fibre operator Vumatel has announced that Dietlof Mare will join the company as its new CEO. Mare brings fourteen years of telecommunications experience to the company, having previously held CEO positions for Vodafone in the DRC, Tanzania and Albania. According to the group, Mare’s experience will see the company through its next phase of growth as it company matures. Niel Schoeman, current CEO of Vumatel will step into an executive chairman role at the company. “This provides Schoeman with the capacity required to focus on the pioneering and transformational projects which Vuma has become known for,” it said. “These projects include closing the digital divide and building smarter safer cities, all which are critical for South Africa’s future.” Vuma is currently reported to be in advanced talks to be acquired by Remgro, where billionaire Johann Rupert is said to be seeking to consolidate South Africa’s expanding broadband infrastructure industry. According to Bloomberg, sources have indicated that a deal by Rupert’s investment vehicle would give an equity value of closely-held Vumatel of about R1.1 billion. A successful deal would see Vumatel and rival Dark Fibre Africa (DFA) combine. Remgro owns a majority stake in DFA. Mare’s appointment is effective 7 May 2018.
