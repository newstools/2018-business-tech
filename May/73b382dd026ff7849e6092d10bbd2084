SqwidNet has launched its new brand, aligning itself with the “dynamic environment the company operates in”, said Phathizwe Malinga, acting CEO of SqwidNet. “As a technology solutions and network provider at the edge of innovation, we realised that it was time to refresh our brand,” said Malinga. This includes a new company logo, which is pictured above. The new brand comes after the resignation of former CEO Reshaad Sha, who left the company to take up the role of CEO at Liquid Telecom South Africa. Sha was also the chief strategy officer at Dark Fibre Africa. “With a fresh leadership team, comes a fresh approach to business,” added Malinga. SqwidNet, in partnership with Sigfox, has rolled out its IoT network across South Africa, and it now covers 83% of the country. “We will continue growing our partner ecosystem to ensure that we can provide businesses in South Africa with IoT solutions,” said Malinga.
