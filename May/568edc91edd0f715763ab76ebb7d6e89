British Airways has announced that it will be introducing a direct, non-stop flight between London’s Heathrow Airport and Durban’s King Shaka International Airport. The route will begin flying a three times weekly schedule and is expected to start on 29th of October 2018, the airline said in a statement on Tuesday (8 May). Speaking on the announcement, MEC of Economic Development Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Sihle Zikalala, said that BA’s decision will allow KwaZulu-Natal to showcase itself as a tourism and business destination to a global audience. “The sheer diversity in travel and business opportunities that visitors can access through this gateway into the province of KwaZulu-Natal will unlock enormous potential.” “We are excited to be able to rekindle that relationship with the launch of this new route. The investment and trade opportunities presented by this direct flight between Durban and London will undoubtedly add value to our economy.” Hamish Erskine, CEO for Dube TradePort, said the Durban-London air service was in line with the global trend where airlines were increasingly flying directly into major secondary cities from global economic hubs. “This presents an enormous opportunity for both destinations to grow business, trade, investment, cultural and tourism links. “Currently, there are some 90,000 passengers flying between London and Durban every year, King Shaka International also saw passenger volumes reach 5.6 million for the first time in the last financial year,” Erskine said.
