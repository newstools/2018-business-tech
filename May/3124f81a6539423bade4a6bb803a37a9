Despite the potential turnaround seen under President Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC has admitted that it could lose majority power in next year’s general elections. This assessment is contained in a document that was presented at a national elections workshop two months ago, but has been kept under wraps until now, reports the Sunday Times. The internal document says the party might not get a majority of more than 50% in 2019, and rates the likelihood that it will have to enter a coalition to remain in power as “high”. It also notes that the ANC may have to go into opposition. According to the document, the drop is likely irrespective of whether Ramaphosa or Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was chosen to head up the party in December 2017, and comes on the back of diminishing ANC voters in the 2014 general elections and the 2016 municipal elections. Notably the party received only 55% of the national vote in the 2016 municipal elections and lost key metropolitan municipalities like Johannesburg, Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay. Possible coalition? With both parties in attendance at Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral in April, reports circulated that party leaders Cyril Ramaphosa and Julius Malema had used the opportunity to discuss a possible partnership in the future. While Malema had said that he did not want to speculate on the possibility of a pre- or post-election alliance, he confirmed that he had spoken to Ramaphosa about what was necessary for co-operation. Another senior EFF leader said there was no possibility of his party collapsing, but that there could be co-operation after the election “based on certain fundamental principles”.
