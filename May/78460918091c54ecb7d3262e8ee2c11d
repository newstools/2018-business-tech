The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has announced a R15 million overhaul of sidewalks and installation of traffic calming measures across five wards in the city. “A list of streets requiring traffic calming measures, maintenance, reinstatements and construction of new sidewalks have been identified,” the JRA said in a statement on Thursday (3 May). “The Region B Sidewalk and Traffic Calming project aligns to Universal Access Requirements to ensure improved safety for non-motorised roads users and persons with disabilities. “The project aims to make a significant social impact with added benefits to the greater community and road users.” The JRA added that it expects the introduction of traffic calming measures to reduce road user accidents, meaning drivers will become more conscious of installed speed humps and will drive at reduce speeds. “Interventions to maintain, rehabilitate and construct sidewalks will ensure the accidents and risk posed to pedestrian and non-motorised roads users are reduced. In addition, the overall improvements will add to the aesthetic appeal of the community streets and will encourage a more active lifestyle by residents,” it said. The JRA’s Acting Managing Director, Goodwill Mbatha said that the labour intensive construction works commenced in April 2018 and are expected to continue for around 12 months.
