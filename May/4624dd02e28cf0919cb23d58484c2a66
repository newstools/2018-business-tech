Banking group Absa announced on Tuesday (15 (May), that its deputy chief executive has stepped down from the company. “David Hodnett has resigned from the Group and Absa Bank and will accordingly, with immediate effect, cease to be executive director and deputy chief executive. David will participate in a handover between now and the end of August 2018. “The board thanks David for his extensive contribution over 10 years with the group, including as chief risk officer and financial director, and most recently as head of the South Africa Banking portfolio, and wishes him well in his future endeavours,” the bank said in a statement. Hodnett’s resignation follows a number of executive changes at Absa recently including a new chief technology officer. Barclays Africa Group advised its shareholders in March of its intention to change its name from Barclays Africa Group Limited to Absa Group Limited. The name change will be effective from 30 May 2018, the bank said. Read: Absa CEO Maria Ramos pockets R37 million salary
