The Automotive Industry Development Centre (AIDC) has launched the first phase of a R50 billion mega-development which will see Rosslyn, north east of Pretoria, become the new automotive manufacturing capital of South Africa. Dubbed the Tshwane Auto City, the AIDC performed a sod turning ceremony at the site of the first multi-billion phase, Rosslyn Hub, which will be a 100 hectare mixed-use project in Rosslyn. Over the next 10 years, the AIDC will oversee a further 7,100 hectares of development in the area, with the ultimate goal to transform Rosslyn and Klerksoord into a concentrated manufacturing cluster and the City of Tshwane into an automotive investment destination. The government aims to increase local vehicle manufacturing to 1.2 million vehicles per annum by 2020. Rosslyn is already home to four automotive plants – for BMW, Nissan, Iveco and Tata – and with the new R3 billion development launching, the area will become a central node for auto manufacturing, and will anchor further development in the area. Upon completion, the hub will include approximately 1,200 houses and 250 rental apartments; schools and university; shopping centres; industrial parks; motor retail areas and other amenities like hospitals and clinics. The project will be funded by the private sector, with government covering road and bulk infrastructure, and is expected to create over 160,000 over its entire development period.
