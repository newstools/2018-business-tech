The Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) has published its latest finding which dealt with a complaint against FNB. The complaint dealt with an advertisement on FNB’s website promoting its ConeXis X2 smartphone as free for any customer on eBucks Reward Level 5. Upon purchasing the device however, the complainant (who was a eBucks Reward Level 5 customer) was charged a fee of R199. As a result he argued that the advertisement was misleading and was in breach of the ASA’s code. FNB responds In responsing to the complaint, FNB confirmed that it was in the process of withdrawing the relevant marketing material and that the advertisement will be completely withdrawn from the public arena by close of business on 25 May 2018. It confirmed further that it will refrain from making the claim of getting the FNB ConeXis range of smart phones for free. In line with a long-standing principle, the ASA said it would not consider the merits of the case as the advertiser (FNB) had admitted fault and that it would not pursue the case further. “Given the above, the Directorate accepts the Respondent’s submissions as an undertaking. The undertaking is accepted on condition the advertisement is not used again in the format complained against in future,” it said. Read: You can now open an FNB account by taking a selfie
