Oracle will see the first of its students graduate from Design Tech (d.tech) High School in June. The $43 million public charter high school opened at its Redwood City, California, headquarters towards the end of 2017, and has 550 students and in excess of 30 staff – while also drawing on the advisory services of staff at the software giant, who act in a voluntary role. Through Oracle Education Foundation, one of Oracle’s educational philanthropic arms, Oracle volunteers work closely with Design Tech High School students on projects at the intersection of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) disciplines. The building includes a two-story workshop space, called the Design Realisation Garage, where students are encouraged to build prototypes  – the latest of which include a robot, go-cart and a bubble-gum machine The Design Tech High School is dedicated to teach fundamentals of design and problem solving, and as a public charter high school, any student can apply to attend through a lottery system. Oracle this week outlined its intent in the cloud space by expanding the scope of autonomous capabilities with built-in AI and machine learning through the availability of Oracle Autonomous Analytics Cloud, Oracle Autonomous Integration Cloud, and Oracle Autonomous Visual Builder Cloud. With built-in advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms, it said these new PaaS services automate and eliminate key tasks to enable companies to lower cost, reduce risk, accelerate innovation, and get predictive insights. The company also updated it service plans, making previously premium priced platinum grade services a standard offering.               Read: Oracle CEO Mark Hurd talks company focus
