Three top executives at Cell C have resigned, and will leave the company in the next few months. Chief financial officer Tyrone Soondarjee, chief procurement and property officer Sherhaad Kajee and chief digital officer Nihmal Marrie have all been confirmed to be leaving. Speaking to the City Press, the executives gave an indication of the reasoning behind the resignations, though Cell C itself could not comment. Soondarjee is leaving under “personal circumstances” and will join a family business; Kajee will be leaving for his personal health; and Marrie is leaving at the end of July, reportedly to join a global company. Soondarjee joined Cell C on 1 July 2017, and his departure at the end of May means he would have been at the company for 11 months. Kajee was appointed as Cell C’s chief procurement and property officer in August 2012, after serving as the managing executive of procurement at Vodacom. And Marrie was appointed as Cell C’s chief digital officer on 1 August 2017. Read: Cell C hits back at CellSAf
