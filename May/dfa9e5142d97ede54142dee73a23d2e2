Isuzu Motors South Africa has launched a limited edition all-black model double cab bakkie range – the X-Rider Black. Isuzu noted that its X-Rider has already been well received in the local market, having been initially launched as a 700 unit limited edition in 2016. Such was the take-up, that the motoring group added it to its range permanently early last year. The X-Rider is painted exclusively in a Black Meet Kettle body colour, including the front grill and bumper guard. This is complimented by black-finished B-pillars, side steps and a sports bar in the load bay. Inside, the cabin, the vehicle has black leather seats, while black trims feature on the vents, audio system, front console and door inserts. The new range comes with a five-year/120,000km bumper-to-bumper warranty and Isuzu Roadside Assistance, a five-year/unlimited km anti-corrosion warranty, and a five-year/90,000 km Service Plan.
