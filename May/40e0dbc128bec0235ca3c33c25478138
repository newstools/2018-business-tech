The University of the Western Cape has announced plans to launch a 100% online and accredited Management Development Programme. The programme – which will launch on 31 May – has been designed to provide aspiring managers and first-line managers with the opportunity to acquire a background in the core functional areas of management, together with the skills necessary to advance into middle management careers, and also to progress to accredited graduate studies in Management or Finance. “Skilled managers are able to make the best use of the resources they have available, inspire and empower their employees, and form meaningful collaborations,” said Prof Kobus Visser, former dean of the UWC Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences. “By doing our bit to produce just that sort of manager, we hope to help build stronger companies, promote job creation and fight unemployment – and ultimately strengthen the economy.” Features UWC said that the Management Development Programme (MDP) is relevant to aspiring managers and junior professionals who are ready to further their careers. The foundation modules of the MDP include Management Skills Development, Introduction to Information Systems and introductory modules in Management and Finance. It is an access programme to accredited postgraduate studies. “Successful graduates of the MDP programme qualify for – and can apply for – the Senior Management Development Programme, which then allows students to continue and complete their studies into an advanced diploma, postgraduate diploma, master’s degree – right up to the PhD level,” UWC said. “The Senior Management Development Programme is designed for experienced professionals who want to continue a successful climb in their management careers.” Acording to UWC, the programme features: No travel required – 24/7 access to the learning environment
