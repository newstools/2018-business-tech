Integrated ICT and communications company Vox, has collaborated with cloud services brokerage First for Cloud and global software company, Veeam to launch a cloud-based backup solution targeted at local business. “Vox Cloud Backup for Veeam enables customers who have Veeam as their onsite backup software solution to connect and automatically store their backups securely to the Vox cloud platform, helping them de-risk their business in this area,” said Craig Freer, Vox executive head for cloud and managed services. The product leverages Veeam’s modern backup technology, including forever incremental backups, and GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son) retention policies. A console gives customers the ability to recover data for restores, track their consumption, and receive reminders for hosted storage renewals. “This product brings together three leading companies, each with its own strengths; Vox provides a local cloud storage platform offering the highest levels of security and reliability, First for Cloud has a broad customer and distribution base, and Veeam brings best-of-breed backup software,” said Freer. The product is available for purchase online, while primary support for the product will be provided by Veeam, with issues being escalated to Vox should there be the requirement to do so. “We’re seeing tremendous growth in the backup space, especially in light growing incidents of malware and ransomware; the reality is if you have an attack on your server and you don’t have a backup, that information is lost. Using a cloud-based backup facility gives them an added layer of redundancy,” said Freer. Read: Vox launches IoT tracking solutions
