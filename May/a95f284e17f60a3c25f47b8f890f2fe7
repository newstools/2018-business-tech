Following the announcement that Volkswagen will be recalling nearly half a million cars due to a rear seatbelt problem on Friday (11 May), the German car manufacturer has confirmed that some local Polo models have been affected. “All current Polo models are affected in SA, since its launch earlier this year,” Volkswagen South Africa said to Wheels24 in a statement on Monday (14 May). “VW will communicate with affected owners in due course.” It added that the Polo is legally homologated and safe to drive – however it advised that customers do not use the middle seat of the new Polo until the car is equipped with the redesigned belt lock fixture. Volkswagen  announced on Friday that it would recall about 220,000 of its new Polo vehicles in the coming weeks due to a problem with the rear seatbelt lock – adding that 191,000 Seats were also affected, Reuters reported. Volkswagen said the recall concerned a technical problem where the rear left seatbelt could be unintentionally released in some rare situations, for example during a fast lane change when the vehicle had five passengers on board. It added the check, as well as the implementation of the belt lock fixture, would be free of charge for the affected Polo as well as Seat’s Ibiza and Arona models.
