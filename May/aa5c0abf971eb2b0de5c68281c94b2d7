Commercial architects Aevitas have published early concept designs for The Falcon Tower – a proposed ‘twin’ to the PwC tower that stands out in the Midrand skyline in the centre of the multi-billion rand Waterfall City development in greater Johannesburg. While details around the project are scarce – as the development is still in proposal stages – The Falcon is envisioned to stand next to the PwC building, on the western side of the Waterfall City Park and town square, and near the the Mall of Africa. The Aevitas concept has been designed as an office development with 50,000 square metres of space on approximately 30 floors. Aevitas and Waterfall City developers Attacq were contacted for more information about the proposal for the tower – including cost and and projected timelines – but did not return comment by the time of publication. Here is the site of the proposed tower:  Here is the Aevitas proposal for the site.  Read: Attacq offers R100,000 to entrepreneurs for ideas to turn Waterfall into a smart city
