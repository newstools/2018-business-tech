The presidency has announced that it will be bringing disciplinary action against suspended SARS commissioner Tom Moyane, on charges of misconduct and a violation of his duties. It has been known for a long time that the disciplinary proceedings were coming, with president Cyril Ramaphosa making it known that the presidency would be pursuing them during his first state of the nation address in February. Moyane was suspended “with immediate effect” in March following a deterioration in the public’s confidence in him to manage the country’s tax affairs. Under Moyane’s leadership at SARS, tax collection faltered, and the suspended commissioner’s name turned up in a number of scandals. Moyane faced criticism from lawmakers for his handling of an investigation into accusations his former deputy Jonas Makwakwa and his partner received R1.2 million in suspicious payments, and allegations of mismanaging tax refunds. Moyane was also the figure who launched the failed investigation into minister Pravin Gordhan and former SARS executives over the so-called “rogue unit”, which relied on a withdrawn KPMG report that was ultimately found to be misrepresentative. In a statement of Friday, the presidency said that the disciplinary action against Moyane will be presided over by retired Constitutional Court Judge Kate O’Rega. The specific charges relate to relate to alleged misconduct in violation of his duties and responsibilities in terms of the South African Revenue Service Act, Public Finance Management Act and the Revenue Service’s code of conduct. A separate commission will investigate the tax shortfalls. Read: SARS commissioner Tom Moyane suspended
