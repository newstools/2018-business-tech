KIA has announced the official pricing for the KIA Stinger GT, heading to South Africa later this year. In a statement released on Thursday (3 May), KIA said that the car will ship standard with KIA’s industry-leading unlimited kilometre, 5-year warranty, as well as five years’ worth of roadside assistance and a 5-year/90,000km maintenance plan for R859,995. Due to the limited number of Stinger available to the South African market in 2018, the vehicle will not be available through the KIA dealership network. Instead, Stinger will feature a bespoke direct sales experience facilitated by KIA Motors South Africa through the dedicated Stinger website. “Customers who register on the Stinger website will receive full details regarding the sales and ordering process later this month, and will be able to order their vehicles at the same time,” KIA said. The SA-bound KIA Stinger GT is powered by KIA’s high-performance 3.3-litre twin-turbocharged V6 GDI (gasoline direct injection) engine that develops 272 kW of power at 6,000 r/min, and 510 Nm of torque between 1,300 and 4,500 r/min. This makes the Stinger the most powerful and fastest-accelerating production KIA ever, with a 0 to 100km/h sprint time of 4,9 seconds and a top speed of 270 km/h. This engine has recently been named on the authoritative Ward’s ’10 Best Engines’ list for 2018 Customers will have a choice of nine metallic exterior colours, including Hi Chroma Red, Snow White Pearl, Silky Silver, Aurora Black Pearl, Ceramic Silver, Sunset Yellow, Deep Chroma Blue, Micro Blue and Panthera Metal.
