Jobs portal CareerJunction has published its annual salary survey for 2018, showing what people earn in 94 jobs across 10 different categories in South Africa. As part of its data processing, the jobs portal also provides a general overview of salary variation differences across South Africa’s three major economic provinces, namely Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal. These provinces cover the three major metros (Joburg, Cape Town and Durban) which account for the bulk of South Africa’s economic activity. In the six months between salary reports, there have been some shifts for regional salaries across different categories – though the general trend has stayed the same: Gauteng remains the highest paying province for most job categories, while KZN stays the lowest-paying. Salaries in the fields of architecture & engineering and warehousing & logistics saw a general increase in salaries across all three major regions, while jobs in ICT, medical, marketing and admin, office & support saw declines across all regions. Regionally, Kwa-Zulu Natal saw massive declines in salaries from 2016, with marketing salaries, finance salaries and admin, office and support salaries coming in massively below the national average (36%, 26% and 28% below, respectively). The tables below show how salaries differ across Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Numbers have been rounded. The salary differences are based on the highest level of intermediate pay, based on the the CareerJunction Salary Survey for 2018.
