It’s happened to all of us, after pulling alongside a sedan or hatchback at a red light, you are then left in shock as the light turns green and it pulls away from you so effortlessly. This is what we expected of the new Ford Fiesta ST which is powered by a new turbocharged 1.5-litre three-cylinder engine delivering 147 kW and 290 N.m to the front wheels. Unfortunately Carmag has received confirmation that the vehicle will not be coming to South Africa due to our poor  ‘fuel quality’, with doubts also cast over the upcoming Focus ST and Focus RS. However, there are still a number of cars that you can purchase in South Africa that promise to be both ‘unassuming’ and offer surprisingly powerful specifications under the hood. BusinessTech looks at six of these cars and how much they cost. Audi RS3 Sportback quattro – R903,500  Engine size: 2.5 litres
