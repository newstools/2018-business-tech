Financial services group Liberty has announced a new partnership with global Telematics Service Provider, The Floow. The partnership means that Liberty Short-Term Insurance will now offer South African motorists the opportunity to prove that they are safe drivers by passing a ‘driver test’ through its app. The app measures a set of robust driver scores, and will indicate whether a driver is deserving of a heavily discounted insurance solution, the company said. “The Floow’s data science and scoring experience is central to the proposition, which was launched in January, aimed at the young professional demographic in South Africa. “Customers are able to quickly receive a quote by communicating with the Liberty Short-Term Insurance chatbot which is available via social media messaging channels, as well as the Liberty Short-Term Insurance app and website,” it said. “That quote reduces in price if the customer is able to achieve minimum driving scores over 300km, recorded via the smartphone app. “Driving scores measure the driver’s distraction on their journeys, as well as how aggressive their driving style is. The driver receives regular feedback from the chatbot during the course of this scoring period to help and encourage them to pass the test. All customer data is encrypted and secured.” It added that once a driver achieves the target driving scores over 300km, they will not only benefit from a competitively priced premium, but will continue to receive useful feedback and tips via the chatbot, as well as the opportunity to earn Uber vouchers for continued safe driving. “This telematics-based personal lines insurance proposition is the first in a range of products to be launched, and we are delighted with the capability and partnership that The Floow has brought to making this happen,” said Marty Epstein, chief executive for Liberty Short-Term Insurance.
