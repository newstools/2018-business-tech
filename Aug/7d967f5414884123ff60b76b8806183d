The City of Johannesburg has confirmed that labour unrest taking place at the Driving Licensing Card Account (DLCA) is affecting its services. The DLCA is a national government department responsible for the printing of all driving licence cards for both provincial and municipal licensing centres. In a statement released on Tuesday (28 August), the city said that this may have affected applications for drivers licences, leading to delays in the issuing of ‘credit card type’ driving licences. To resolve the problem on a temporary basis, City of Johannesburg Licensing Centres will be issuing temporary licences to new as well as renewing driving licence applicants, it said. These will be valid for six months and can be renewed in the event that issues at DLCA remain unresolved at the time of their expiry. “We are concerned about the unresolved and ongoing labour unrest at the DLCA as it has seriously impacted our service delivery to the residents of Johannesburg,” said Public Safety MMC Michael Sun. We will be engaging with the relevant Department of Transport and ensure that the temporary solution will bring minimal inconvenience to our customers.” He added that all other services available at the City’s Licensing Centres remain unaffected. “The city’s Licensing Department will continue to update residents on the labour unrest at the DLCA as well as when the issuing of credit card type driving licences will commence,” he said.
