MyBroadband recently published a list of the fastest mobile speeds measured in South Africa during a series of driving tests. These tests were conducted using high-end LTE smartphones, including Samsung Galaxy S8 and S9 devices, and a custom version of the MyBroadband Android Speed Test App. It found that the newcomer Rain had the fastest highest mobile speed measured – hitting an incredible 196Mbps download and 28Mbps upload in the Broadacres area. Speaking to BusinessTech, chief operating officer of Rain South Africa, Kartik Mistry, said that the phone model used in the tests was important. “It’s extremely important to have the right quality of phone to ensure that a user can benefit from the features of the network,” he said. He added that while there aren’t any specific settings on a router to improve speeds, there are two important factors to consider when one looks for general improvement of internet for one’s home or mobile use. “As mentioned above, the quality of your device, either your smartphone or router, is important,” he said. “The other is the placement of your device, specifically in the case of a router, is also very important. There are factors that may influence your connection and speed, and generally placing your router near a window helps with your experience.” Mistry said that Rain also had a number of plans to expand and upgrade it network in the coming years. “We continue to grow our network daily. We are currently at 2,000+ sites and aim to have 5,000 towers in three years,” he said. Read: Here’s what to expect from the new iPhone which could launch next month
