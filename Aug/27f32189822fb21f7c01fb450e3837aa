Following the successful launch of its Mercedes Benz X-Class in May this year, Mercedes has promised to bring its top of  the line X350d 4Matic to South Africa at the beginning of 2019. The X350d 4Matic will be powered by a 3.0 litre turbocharged V6 diesel motor, delivering 190 kW (258 hp) and a maximum torque of 550 newton metres, with peak torque coming between 1,400 rpm and 3,200 rpm. This top model sprints from zero to 100 km/h in 7.9 seconds, the German carmaker said in a statement in March. With current pricing for the X-Class ranging from around R640,000 – R800,000, the X350d 4Matic also has the potential to be the first bakkie to pass the R1 million mark, according to Car mag – who notes that Mercedes has been cagey on what the car will ultimately cost in South Africa. It added that there have been rumours of a R950,000 price sticker, but this could creep up due to the volatile rand and other international considerations. If you also factor in the range of optional extras that can  be purchased alongside the current X-Class iterations, this price point becomes even more realistic. While this R1 million could put the new X-Class out of reach for some, there is already a well established ‘premium bakkie’ market in the country – including models from well established manufacturers such as Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota.
