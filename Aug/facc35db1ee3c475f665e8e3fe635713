Multichoice has announced the winning bid to replace the channel space previously occupied by the Gupta-linked Afro Worldview (formerly ANN7). The media group said that Newzroom Afrika has been selected to produce the new 24-hour news channel to be broadcast on DStv. The channel is a new company formed by television production entrepreneurs Thokozani Nkosi of Eclipse TV, and Thabile Ngwato of Rapid Innovation. “Their bid stood out for its potential to bring a fresh, creative and diversified approach to news reporting, which included an integrated digital strategy, combined with sound audience analysis and appealing on-screen execution,” Multichoice said. “Accomplished television executive Zanele Mthembu will head the broadcast operation; while the newsroom will be under the leadership of veteran news media executive and journalist Malebo Phage. There will be an editorial ethics oversight board spearheaded by Joe Thloloe and Dinesh Balliah, a forward-thinking journalist and academic.” Multichoice SA CEO Calvo Mawela said that the group set out to find a quality new, black-owned, independent news channel to expand the diversity of SA news and enrich our democracy, and that it was happy with the outcome. “The Eclipse TV and Rapid Innovation teams have a track record of entrepreneurial success. They will be supported by an editorial team that will deliver independent views of events unfolding in South Africa and around the world, while the owners concentrate on running the business successfully. As with other news channels on DStv such as SABC News, eNCA, Business Day TV, CNN, Sky News and Al Jazeera, Multichoice said it will have no editorial oversight over the new channel. Further details about the channel are expected to be shared in the coming weeks. The parties will start negotiating the terms of a Channel Distribution Agreement shortly, Multichoice said.
