Real estate group Private Property has published data on the 10 most in-demand property markets in Pretoria, including the median asking prices currently listed among its data. The group’s data is compiled using search activity and median asking prices of residential properties listings on Private Property’s website for the month of July 2018. It takes into account asking prices only, and not the prices that houses will eventually go on to sell for. According to Private Property, Pretoria has been growing in popularity among buyers, particularly upcoming professionals and young families. However, along with growing popularity, Pretoria has been noted by Numbeo and Expatistan indices as being South Africa’s most expensive city to live in. But this doesn’t mean that well-priced homes cannot be found, Private Property said, noting that many of the city’s suburbs offer a wide variety for all kinds of people. The median price of a property in Pretoria is currently at R1.34 million, the group said – these are the 10 most in-demand suburbs, based on the number of views listings on the Private Property website got in July. The prices listed are the median prices overall, and the median pries for a house, a flat or a unit in a complex.
