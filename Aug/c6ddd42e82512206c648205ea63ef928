Internet Solutions (IS) says it will become more open and actively engage in peering after reviewing its peering policy and implementing several changes to promote better interconnection. Peering is broadly defined as two Internet Service Providers connecting to exchange traffic directly with each other to benefit each other’s networks. The ISP said it will be taking a more open approach to peering and the overall theme of the revised peering policy is to be simpler and more inclusive. The advantages of a more open peering policy means that local traffic will be served more directly to end users of the service, while reducing the amount of traffic that needs to leave our shores to access content that is available locally, it said. IS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Dimension Data Group and part of NTT. “By becoming more open and actively engaging in peering, we are creating numerous opportunities that will result in improved user experience by adding resiliency, keeping traffic localised and driving the cost of Internet connectivity down,” said Kervin Pillay, chief technology officer at Internet Solutions. “An open peering policy will allow established network providers to peer with IS that were previously unable to do so. We are also making it simpler for Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers to peer with us. “By making this change, we believe that we will provide more opportunities for our clients and other established networks in the country,” Pillay said.
