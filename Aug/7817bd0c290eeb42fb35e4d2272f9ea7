Former president Jacob Zuma, ANC politicians and Eastern Cape royalty were reportedly given prized cows worth millions of rands – bought with public money meant to benefit poor Eastern Cape farmers. According to a report by The Sunday Times, this was confirmed by former OR Tambo district municipality mayor Zoleka Capa — who is now chair of parliament’s portfolio committee on social development and a close ally of Zuma, Capa admitted she had given cows to the former president, and had taken cows for herself to give to community members. Originally purchased as part of an upliftment plan by the OR Tambo municipality, the cattle were bought in 2008 for R62 million from a cluster of seven farms near Kokstad in KwaZulu-Natal, while a further R30 million was spent buying 1,800 cows and farming equipment. It was estimated that the herd would increase to 10,000 within 10 years. Instead, the cattle were distributed to councillors and politicians. Now only about 800 remain – some of which are only calves. Speaking to The Sunday Times, sources working closely with the project alleged that about 50 head of cattle — including Brahman and Sussex cows — were taken to Nkandla. Others alleged to have scored big are Capa’s husband, Ndumiso Capa; traditional leader and former King, Sabata Dalindyebo; municipality councillor, Solly Nduku; and KwaCele councillor Fikile Magaya.
