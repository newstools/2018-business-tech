Gauteng will be hosting the Metropolis Annual Meeting this week, where plans will be discussed on how to turn the province’s three core metro areas – Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane – into a ‘megatropolis’ by 2030 and beyond. According to a report by the City Press, the plans are within National Development Plan, and will see the development of new economic hubs in the province, along with additions to the transport networks, and focusing specific industries in different regions. For instance, 12 new Gautrain stations will be built in the next phase, giving access to different parts of the mega-city-to-be, which will feed new planned “agriopolis” (farming) and “aeropolis” (freight and logistics) economic hubs in the south and east of the province. The plans also include the establishment of ‘mega human settlements’, with ‘social housing’ instead of RDP houses, and a new regional airport. There is also a focus on tourism, with the Magaliesburg region expected to be the core area. As the cities of Johannesburg and Tshwane slowly merge into one mega-city, the current middle-ground – Midrand and Centurion – are expected to become “the new Sandton”, the paper said.
