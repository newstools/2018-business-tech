[IOL] Transnet’s CEO and two other senior officials have been told they will be suspended, the group’s chairman has announced. While the exact reasons for the suspensions have not been divulged, the announcement follows several probes into misconduct at the SOE – including a probe into over 1,000 locomotives that were acquired for R54 billion. [Reuters] New investigations by amaBhungane have uncovered how R600 million was siphoned out of state-owned companies through the Guptas’ network of contacts. A paper trail shows how Gupta partner Salim Essa scored contracts with SOEs through ‘business development’ deals. [amaBhungane] Wage talks at Eskom are again under threat as the power utility seeks arbitration over disciplinary measures for workers that embarked on illegal strikes. Unions want the workers to be given a free pass – however, Eskom said it cannot do so. Striking workers sabotaged power supply which led to load shedding being implemented. [Reuters] South Africa’s rand slumped on Wednesday as ratings agency Moody’s warned that the pace of fiscal consolidation in Africa’s most industrialised nation had slowed and retail sales data disappointed, underlining the fragility of the economy. On Thursday the rand was at R14.36 to the dollar, R18.28 to the pound and R16.36 to the euro.
