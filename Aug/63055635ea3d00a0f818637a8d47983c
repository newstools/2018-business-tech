The Department of Energy and members of the motoring industry have finalised their wage tables for 2018/2019. This includes the minimum wages for a number of personnel working in the fuel sector – including petrol attendants and cashiers. The changes will come into affect from September, with the retail margin adjustment of 4.9 cents per litre (from 187.2 cpl to 192.1 cpl) to be officially implemented by the Department of Energy on the 5th of September 2018. This increase in margin is ring-fenced for wage adjustments only. In 2017, the Fuel Retailer’s Association said that petrol stations employ around 70,000 people across the country, with petrol attendants generally fitting the profile of 27 year old men, who tend to stay in the job for up to five years. Engen has previously indicated that it alone employs around 19,000 ‘service station staff’ at just over a thousand service stations in South Africa. While the gazetted minimum wage gives an indication of the lowest amount a petrol attendant can legally get paid, it is not fully reflective of what petrol attendants actually earn. For one, tipping petrol attendants has become customary in South Africa, as the attendants perform many ‘complimentary’ services, such as washing windows, checking oil, and inflating tyres. This adds to an attendant’s final take at the end of the month. Attendants also receive varying wages depending on where in the country they work, and who they work for. This is acknowledged in the official wage documentation, and an employer who has granted an increase over and above the prescribed increases during the preceding 12 months may offset those increases against the increases set out below – provided that no wage increases shall be offset on more than one occasion.
