Ipsos has released its latest survey focusing on the biggest issues troubling people around the world. The survey is conducted monthly in 28 countries around the world via the Ipsos Online Panel system. Weighting has been employed to balance demographics and ensure that the sample’s composition reflects that of the adult population according to the most recent country census data. However due to the lower levels of internet penetration on South Africa, Ipsos noted that the sample should not be considered nationally representative and instead should be considered to represent a more affluent, connected population. “These are still a vital social group to understand in these countries, representing an important and emerging middle class,” Ipsos said. According to the survey, the majority of people in the participating 28 nations feel their country is on the wrong track (56%) on average, with Brazil (85%), Peru (78%), South Africa (76%) and Hungary (74%) citing the greatest levels of concern. Once more, China (91%) inspires the most confidence about national direction. Saudi Arabia (76%) remain in second place with India (67%) now placed third replacing South Korea (63%) who tail off into fifth place behind Malaysia who take fourth position (66%). At the other end of the spectrum Brazilian, Peruvian, South African and Hungarian citizens have the greatest apprehension about the direction taken by their country. Just 15% of Brazilians think their country is going in the right direction, followed by 22% in Peru and 24% in South Africa and 26% in Hungary. The biggest concerns raised amongst South Africans include: Crime and violence (59%)
