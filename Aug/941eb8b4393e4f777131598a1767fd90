Business Connexion Group (BCX) chief operating officer Mike Buttner has reportedly resigned from his position. This is according to an email sent to staff by CEO Jonas Bogoshi, which MyBroadband has seen. “His stay may have been short, but it is my personal opinion that Mike Buttner’s brief time with us as COO has been a meaningful and impactful one,” said Bogoshi. “Mike has resigned for personal reasons and he will be following a new professional path closer to home, in Cape Town.” BCX is currently looking for a replacement for the COO, with Leon Gerber acting as interim COO. “I would like to thank Mike for being at the forefront of implementing our operating model and leading a team that is passionate about delivering the best to our customers.” Telkom, the parent company of BCX, did not immediately respond to requests for comment from MyBroadband.
