The Volkswagen and Audi brands have again dominated the top positions in the latest automotive customer care survey conducted by Ipsos in South Africa. The research was based on interviews with more than 20,000 customers in 2017, covering both purchasing and servicing experiences. The sample of participating brands in the latest survey represented more than three out of every four new cars and light commercial vehicles sold through dealership channels in South Africa in 2017. Ispos noted that Volkswagen and Audi brands have been in leadership positions in the purchasing experience in these annual Ipsos surveys for a number of years. Both brands once again attained gold awards for the customer purchasing experience with Volkswagen also collecting gold in the LCV sales category Ipsos said that Nissan has also made very positive strides in both its purchasing and servicing operations at its dealers and collected gold awards in both categories among local passenger car and light commercial vehicle buyers. “The consistency of good service that some brands deliver across their dealer network to so many customers over time is highly commendable as consistency is one of the most important factors in building a powerful brand reputation,” said Patrick Busschau, business unit director at Ipsos. “Volkswagen and Audi brands continue to maintain particularly high levels of customer satisfaction in terms of both the buying and servicing of new passenger vehicles, year after year, despite facing very tough opposition in the local market,” he said. “What is also pleasing to note is that a number of other brands are also upping their game to challenge for the Gold medal positions as well. Nissan is now seeing the fruits of their labours in all categories while Toyota can also see reward for their consistent effort in the Passenger Car Servicing and both Sales and Servicing for Light Commercials “These latest results underline the fact that the custodians of these brands are certainly not sitting back and resting on their laurels but rather use the customer feedback from our ongoing surveys as well as other sources to improve areas of weakness.” Passenger car purchasing experience Gold: Audi, Nissan, and Volkswagen
