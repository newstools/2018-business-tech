HMD Global has announced that the new Nokia 3.1 is available to buy from MTN and Vodacom as well as leading retailers for R2,299.00 The manufacturer said that the Nokia 3.1 is its most affordable 18:9 smartphone – delivering the same screen ratio you get on modern flagships. It boasts a larger 5.2-inch HD+ display which is protected by damage resistant 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Internally the Nokia 3.1 runs MediaTek 6750, an octa-core chipset, giving you twice the processor cores and a 50% performance boost on the previous generation – alongside 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. It also ships with Android Oreo out of the box, meaning you’ll be able to enjoy the latest features – including Google Assistant, Google Lens, and Picture-in-Picture for multitasking. Colours available include blue/copper and black/chrome.  Budget options HMD Global’s latest offering could be a big hit in South Africa given its budget price and premium features such as Gorilla glass. However it will likely face steep competition in a budget market where South African’s now expect flagship features as a given with their new phone purchases.
