Jobs portal CareerJunction has released its latest index for July 2018, showing which job skills are most in-demand in South Africa right now. According to the group, the overall index started the month just under 100, indicating that the local jobs market was fairly stable, with both supply (the number of people seeking jobs) and demand (number of employers hiring) increasing since June. The ICT sector, as well the architecture, engineering and construction sectors in particular saw a boost in the uptake of jobs – while demand for software developers continued to increase – rising by 12% month on month. On the other side, demand has been weakening for sales, marketing and admin positions, the group said. These are the three jobs that are currently trending, according to CareerJunction’s data: Architecture Average salary offerings for senior level positions: GP: R45,938 to R56,574 p.m. (CTC)

KZN: R20,300 to R28,071 p.m. (CTC) In-demand job skills As has been the trend for much of 2018, South African employers are looking for three main sets of skills – specifically software developers, middle/department managers and financial/project accountants. Demand for software developers strengthened by 12% from June to July 2018, with software development and programming remaining the most sought-after skill sets on CareerJunction. Employment opportunities for professionals in management are plentiful, CareerJunction said, with managerial vacancies increasing by 3% during July. Finance managers and sales managers are particularly well sought after. Financial / project accountants are high in demand within the South African job market – however, hiring activity has slowed down during the past 3 months, resulting in a 6% decrease in jobs since May 2018, the group noted.  Across the various sectors job volumes have been relatively stable within the manufacturing & assembly, finance and business & management sectors over the past few months. “Demand for finance professionals as well as business & management professionals is similar to that seen at the beginning of the year, while the manufacturing sector saw an uptake in jobs of 9% since January 2018.” Despite a recent uptake in jobs, demand for professionals in sales, marketing and admin, office & support has weakened considerably during the past year. “Since July 2017, job volumes have decreased by 25% in both the sales and admin, office & support sectors while the marketing sector saw a decrease in jobs of 46%,” CareerJunction said. Meanwhile, a volatile demand trend is evident in the engineering and construction sectors as well as the ICT and medical sectors for the past 12 months. “While jobs are on the rise for architecture & engineering, construction and ICT professionals, the opposite is seen for medical professionals, who can expect a slightly more challenging job hunt,” the group said.
