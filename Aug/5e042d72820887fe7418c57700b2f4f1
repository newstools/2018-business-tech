Uber has hiked minimum fare charges across the country. According to the group, the minimum fare charge for all UberX rides is being increased from R20 to R25. The change came into effect from 31 July. However, it noted that the previous minimum fare of R20 will still apply to all trips starting in Soweto, while the Port Elizabeth uberGO minimum fare has also changed from R17 to R20. “Even with this small increase, Uber remains one of the most affordable and efficient ways to get around your city. You will still enjoy the reliable service you have come to expect from us,” it said. The price hikes come on the back of a small increase in the petrol price in South Africa. Even though both grades of petrol (93 and 95) only increased by a cent on Wednesday, it still marks the fifth consecutive month of increases – with more hikes expected. Uber drivers went on strike in June 2018, protesting against the 25% service fee charged by Uber per ride. Uber said it was looking to trial a ‘tiered service fee’ for drivers, where the more trips completed by a driver-partner and the higher their rating, the lower their weekly Uber service fee is. “As more drivers look to Uber as an earning opportunity, this small increase will still make it possible for riders to access affordable transport whilst providing profitable earnings for driver-partners,” it said.
