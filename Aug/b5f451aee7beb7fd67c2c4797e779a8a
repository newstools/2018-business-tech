Its been a busy week for South African motoring, with a number of new model and pricing announcements. This weekend also plays host to the SA Festival of Motoring (31 August – 2 September), where a number of manufacturers are expected to make further announcements and show off their latest vehicles. Below, BusinessTech looks at what has been announced so far, as well as how much you can expect to pay when these cars officially launch in South Africa. New Mercedes-Benz A-Class – from R499,000  Mercedes-Benz officially launched its new A-Class in South Africa. The compact vehicle is available in two variants – the A200 and the A250 Sport, with the diesel model expected in early 2019. The A200 is powered by a 1.33-litre unit which generates 120 kW and 250 Nm of torque with a 7G DCT dual-clutch transmission (5.2 l/100 km). The 2.0-litre engine of the A250 Sport generates 165 kW and 350 Nm and is available with the 7G-DCT dual-clutch transmission which provides a claimed fuel consumption of 6.2 l/100 km. The new A-Class is also the first Mercedes-Benz model to feature the intelligent multimedia system MBUX – Mercedes-Benz User Experience. Pricing for the new A-Class starts at R499,000 for the A200, and R593,300 for the A250 Sport. New Suzuki Jimny – from R265,000  Suzuki revealed its new Jimny at the 2018 Johannesburg Festival of Motoring in Johannesburg on Thursday (30 August). Alongside a new angular design, clamshell bonnet, and upright grille, the new Jimny will include a full drip rail around the roof – allowing for the easy fitment of a number of roof rails and other accessories. Under the bonnet, Suzuki has fitted its modern K15B petrol engine. This 1.5 litre four-cylinder unit replaces the 1.3 litre M13A engine of the previous model and delivers 75 kW at 6,000 rpm and 130 Nm at 4,000 rpm. Internally Suzuki has added its 7” SLDA – smartphone linkage display – to the new GLX-specification. This large touchscreen is fitted with Apple Carplay, Android Auto, and Mirror Link to accommodate most smartphones’ in-car features and voice control functionality. Suzuki also provided indicative pricing (not officially confirmed), and said that the Jimny would ship with both a  service plan and mechanical warranty. Suzuki Jimny 1.5 4×4 GA Manual: R265,000

Suzuki Jimny 1.5 4×4 GLX Auto: R320,000 The all-new Jimny will be available to customers from 1 November but interested buyers can view pre-production versions of the new model at the Johannesburg Festival of Motoring. The Toyota GT86 – from R575,700  A revamp of its current 86 line, Toyota said that the GT86 will start at R575,700 in South Africa. Visual changes include a black treatment to the rear spoiler and side mirrors, while new black hued 17-inch alloy wheel completes the black-out theme. A newly fitted touchscreen infotainment system occupies the dashboard – complete with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Show Plus functionality. This allows users to ‘mirror’ apps on their smartphone and stream both music – and navigation services from apps such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Waze, to the vehicle’s audio screen. However, the model retains its 2.0 litre D-4S Boxer engine delivering 147 kW at 7,000 rpm and 205 Nm at 6,400 – 6,600 rpm. Renault Duster Oroch – pricing N/A  Renault South Africa confirmed to CarMag earlier this week that it is looking at bringing its new Duster Oroch bakkie to the country in 2020. The Duster Oroch is currently manufactured in South America and is based on the Duster SUV framework. It has four doors, space for five passengers, a 650 kilograms (1,430 lb) load capacity and is currently manufactured in both a 1.6 and 2.0-litre variant. The South American Oroch is currently offered with an array of options including a rear sports bar, soft cargo cover, fog lights, side steps, cargo extension and cabin protection bars. The new-look Hilux and added variants – from R253,200  Following the release of the Dakar Limited Edition, Toyota has announced further tweaks to its popular bakkie range. This will include a number of changes to its mid-tier Hilux SRX models as well its range-topping Raider models, Toyota said. The new SRX model adopts a black-themed front design, while colour-coded bumpers remain inheriting a matching stylised skid plate on the lower apron. Functional black side steps and side mirrors add a rugged touch, Toyota said. The new model will also feature auto light control incorporating a follow-me-home functionality, and all SRX models will inherit a 4-speaker touchscreen infotainment system (previously utilised on Raider grade) with Bluetooth and USB interface. Toyota added that its range-topping Raider models will receive a chrome grille surround which offsets the black horizontal slats and ‘creates a premium appearance’. Its touchscreen multimedia system has also been upgraded to include satellite navigation and DVD-playback compatibility. Alongside these changes, Toyota said it would also add new Single-Cab, Xtra Cab, Double Cab variants – including plans to re-introduce its ‘Chassis-Cab’ Hilux variants.
