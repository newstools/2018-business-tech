Old Mutual is working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to bring a series of innovative services to its South African clients. Speaking on Wednesday (29 August), Vuyo Mpako, chief digital and data officer at Old Mutual said that working with AWS will allow the financial services giant to ‘bring innovation and agility for emerging markets to life’. “The Old Mutual chatbot, currently available on www.oldmutual.co.za, is one of the first solutions in a series to be delivered over the coming months,” he said. “The chatbot is the first step into conversational artificial intelligence (AI) that is leveraging the myriad of innovative solutions like Amazon Lex, a service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text. “Going forward we will see the automation of many of our digital propositions and respond to the needs of our customers in real time. This ultimately results in a better user experience for our customers as we work toward helping them do great things every day.” In addition to benefitting from AWS’s scalability and flexibility, Mpako said that the company expects significant cost saving due to a reduction in time-to-market and efficiencies. “We’ve assessed a number of cloud offerings and believe AWS offers the most comprehensive and mature collection of services. The reduction in costs for upfront investment in new solutions, as well as hardware maintenance, allows for the delivery of next generation digital solutions,” he said.
