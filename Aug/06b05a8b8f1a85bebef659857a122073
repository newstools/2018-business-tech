A refurbishment of one of South Africa’s top-rated luxury game reserve lodges is now complete, and is again welcoming guests – offering exclusive use of its top-tiered facilities for R100,000 per night. The Ulusaba Private Game Reserve is Sir Richard Branson’s (of Virgin fame) private game reserve in South Africa, which sits within the Sabi Sand Game Reserve near Kruger National Park, surrounded by 13,500 hectares of open bush. The reserve comprises 21 rooms and suites across two lodges, which were refurbished back in March 2018, introducing two new takes on the available rooms. The new suite accommodates two guests and comes complete with a private plunge pool and garden, separate lounge and large outdoor deck offering views of the Mabrak riverbed, bush and beyond. Ulusaba also opened a larger and newly refurbished Safari Room, for two people. The Safari Suite and Safari Room can be interconnected and is available on an exclusive use basis for up to four people. According to the rate card for the lodges, prices start at R21,185 per person per night, moving up to R99,500 per person per night for exclusive use of the entire lodge.
