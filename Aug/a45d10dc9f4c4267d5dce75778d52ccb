The SABC and Multichoice have announced that they have signed a new commercial channel supply agreement, allowing the SABC News and SABC Encore channels to continue to be broadcast on DStv. “The agreement follows extensive discussions between the parties as the previous contract is set to expire. SABC and Multichoice believe that this agreement will give their relationship a new start,” the broadcaster said. DStv customers will be able to view news coverage from SABC News on channel 404, with SABC Encore on channel 156. The SABC archives, which the SABC uses to produce SABC Encore, remains the wholly-owned property of the SABC, the broadcaster noted. “The SABC welcomes the new agreement with Multichoice which will bring certainty to our viewers and our staff. The board and management of the SABC are satisfied that the agreement meets both the commercial and governance needs of the SABC. The SABC looks forward to delivering high quality channels into the future,” said SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe. DStv described the terms of the deal as “mutually beneficial”.
