The Nippon Telegraph & Telephone group (NTT) will launch a new company which will oversee its three major communications and data subsidiaries – NTT Data, NTT Communications, and Dimension Data. This is according to Nikkei, which said shares from the subsidiaries will be transferred to the new company to form Japan’s biggest IT provider. “The resulting company will provide corporate clients with a wide range of services, including cloud storage and data processing,” stated Nikkei. Nikkei said the new company will be set up in the coming months and, will challenge companies like IBM and Google. MyBroadband reported that another development linked to Dimension Data is that Investec has gone to market to attract potential buyers for VAST Networks, which is owned by Dimension Data and Naspers. VAST Networks was established in 2015 as a joint venture between Dimension Data and Naspers, which own 51% and 49% of the company respectively. The company is an open-access WiFi network infrastructure provider, delivering carrier-grade WiFi in Southern Africa. MyBroadband asked VAST Networks for feedback on the matter, but the company said it does not comment on speculation. Dimension Data echoed VAST Networks’ comment, while Naspers communications director Anika Ebrahim said: “It is our policy to neither acknowledge nor deny our involvement in any merger, acquisition, or divestiture activity, nor to comment on market speculation.” Read: Dimension Data acquires a majority stake in E2y
