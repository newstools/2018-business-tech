BitCo Telecoms has announced a new partnership with Starbucks South Africa which will see it provide its local stores with uncapped and uncontended Fibre with speeds of up to 1Gbps – a first for the franchise globally. BitCo said that the roll-out has begun in selected stores already and will continue throughout all stores nationwide. The new Starbucks stores in Johannesburg’s Melrose Arch and The Marc (previously known as Village Walk), which recently opened their doors are also the first to experience high speed Free Wi-Fi provided by BitCo that is connected to the 1Gbps line, it said. “Part and parcel of providing our customers with a memorable third place experience, is equipping them with all they need for a seamless visit,” said Starbucks SA managing executive, Clive Liversage. “Fast, reliable Internet access is therefore hugely necessary for an environment like ours, where many of our customers come to work remotely,” Liversage said. He added that with plans to open upwards of 50 stores nationwide in the next few years, the Starbucks partnership presents BitCo with the perfect platform to continue to revolutionise business connectivity. When Starbucks opened its 12th store in South Africa in July 2018, it was dubbed the retailer with the fastest Wi-Fi, boasting download speeds of 100Mbps. With South Africa’s coffee market continuing to grow, the franchise is sure to benefit from BitCo’s faster-than-ever Internet speeds that will entice new customers to pay the coffeehouse a visit, he said.
