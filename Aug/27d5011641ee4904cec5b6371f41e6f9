South African Express (SAX) has announced that it will resume its operations on 23 August 2018. This follows the recent reinstatement of both the airline’s Air Operator’s Certificate (AOC) and Aircraft Maintenance Organisation (AMO) licences by the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA), it said in a statement on Thursday (16 August). It added that SAX has also already received Certificates of Airworthiness for most of its 11 aircraft from SACAA, with the remaining fleet expected to be given the green light soon. “We are delighted that we have now satisfied the concerns that the regulator had leading to our temporary grounding at the end of May this year. This has paved the way for us to prudently and incrementally reintroduce our flights as from August 23, 2018,” SAX Interim CEO, Siza Mzimela said. “We would like to thank all our valued customers and loyal staff for bearing with us while we were addressing the regulators operational requirements,” she added. “Indeed, our temporary grounding was an opportune time for the airline to interrogate all aspects of our operation, as well as our customer value proposition. “It’s all systems go now and we are coming back stronger, more focused and energised. In this regard, we are determined going forward to set new industry standards for safety, product quality and customer service,” upbeat Mzimela said.
