SuperSport’s entire channel offering in South Africa will soon be available in High Definition (HD) with SS9 and Maximo, the remaining channels still available in Standard Definition (SD), set for an upgrade. SuperSport 9 – soon to be the home of Italian Serie A football – will switch to HD on Wednesday 15 August, in time for the start of the Serie A season on Saturday, August 18. Maximo, which is available in Portuguese and offers mainly football, will make the switch a week earlier (on 8 August) in time for the start of the new Premier League season. “Being able to offer all our customers the full complement of our channels in full HD is a momentous occasion for us,” said Gideon Khobane, CEO of SuperSport. “This feat helps position SuperSport as a company at the forefront of cutting-edge technology and will greatly enhance the viewing experience of our customers.” SuperSport’s offering currently stands at 14 channels: Blitz, SS1 – SS12 and Maximo. The sports broadcaster recently indicated that it was also working on implementing 4K streaming on its DStv Now app. “We’re continuing to develop DStv Now, with 4K streaming in testing and smart TV and Apple TV apps on their way shortly,” said MultiChoice Chief Operating Officer Mark Rayner. “The other key priority for us is working with the telcos to deliver mobile data propositions that make watching online painless and worry-free for our customers,” said Rayner.
