According to online job aggregator Adzuna, there has been a massive boom in the software developer job market, where it has been described as “perhaps the fastest growing job market of our time”. “Almost every industry out there has a growing demand for professional software developers. As our technology rapidly evolves, we are becoming more and more dependent on seasoned developers that can set up and maintain digital systems,” said Jesse Green, country manager for Adzuna South Africa. “As the world grows more reliant on technology to get things done, the role of a developer is more crucial than ever before.” In the past, software engineering wasn’t a viable career if you lived outside the city centres of Johannesburg or Cape Town, but today the profession pays well across all provinces in South Africa, he said. However, the three top-paying provinces for software developer salaries remain Gauteng, Western Cape, and KwaZulu Natal. The top-paying city for this field in South Africa is Johannesburg, with an average salary of R519,936 per year, Green said. Other cities with a strong climate for developers include Cape Town with an average salary of R475,458 per year, and Durban, with an average salary of R357,904 per year, Adzuna said. Adzuna collected data from over 140,000 job vacancies and pinpointed areas where software engineers and developers could expect the most growth. The most in-demand skills that employers require from software developers include: HTML/CSS
JavaScript
Responsive Design
Testing/ Debugging
Web Performance
Command Line “Regarding job creation, the developer industry is doing much better than most other industries.  The expansion of the internet in even the most rural of areas will ensure that job prospects for software engineers will continue to grow worldwide for years to come,” Green said.
