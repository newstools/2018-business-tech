With the petrol price continuing to rise, it is well worth it to know how to calculate your car’s fuel efficiency. This is according to to the Automobile Association (AA), which notes that calculating your fuel efficiency allows you to budget more accurately, and also make some improvements to how you drive. “It is estimated 8% more fuel can be used on a return intercity trip when air conditioning is used for most of the journey,” it said. “In hot summer months, this can most definitely affect your fuel consumption negatively, especially when you’re sitting in peak-time traffic.” It added that the following factors could affect your car’s fuel consumption: Irregular servicing
Under-inflated tyres
Air conditioning
Traffic density
Air temperature
Humidity
The way you drive your car Calculating your car’s fuel consumption To make sure the numbers are as accurate as possible when calculating fuel consumption, the AA outlined the following steps: Fill up your car until the self-trigger mechanism clicks (work from a full tank).
Zero your trip meter.
Drive your car like you normally do – to work and back, on highways or arterial roads, etc.
Drive for around 400 km.
Full up your tank again.
Write down your distance travelled, and litres of fuel used. “Now, you’ll be able to calculate your car’s efficiency, based on how you normally drive,” the AA said. “For the most accurate results, we recommend doing this test twice and comparing results, bearing in mind traffic flow, weather conditions, and if you made any changes to how you drive,” it said.
