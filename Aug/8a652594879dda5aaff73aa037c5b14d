The Mall of Africa in Midrand has been shut down and evacuated due to a bomb threat on Wednesday. The group pushed out a statement saying that its central management received the threat, and evacuation procedures were immediately activated. The South African Police Service and other emergency response personnel were called to the mall to assess the situation. “The safety of our tenants and shoppers is paramount, and we thank everyone for so swiftly and effectively implementing our established evacuation and emergency procedures,” the group said. The mall is now closed and will remain so until the threat has been fully investigated. The bomb threat is the latest in a spate of similar incidents that have hit malls in Gauteng in recent weeks. On Friday (24 August) South Gate Mall in the south of Johannesburg was also evacuated after reports were called in of a suspicious device being found at one of the stores. Following the threats made at Mall of Africa, Nelson Mandela Square in Sandton was also subject to bomb threats. The mall conducted a partial evacuation of the area, but has since confirmed no threats. “Nelson Mandela Square along with the South African Police Service, The Bomb Squad and emergency services have thoroughly investigated the area and have confirmed the scene to be clear of any threat,” it said. Several malls in KwaZulu Natal were recently forced to beef up security after incendiary devices were found at some Woolworths stores in July.
