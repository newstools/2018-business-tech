Renault South Africa has confirmed that it is looking at bringing its new Duster Oroch bakkie to the country. Speaking to CarMag, the car manufacturer said that it is targeting a 2020 introduction for its four-door unibody bakkie, but fell short of an exact timeframe as its international models are currently left-hand drive only. Renault Australia recently indicated that a right-hand drive production of the bakkie looks positive, with the Duster Oroch a likely import towards the end of 2019. In addition to Australia and South Africa, Renault had previously confirmed that the Duster Oroch will be available in other European markets. The Duster Oroch is currently manufactured in South America, and is based on the Duster SUV framework. It has four doors, space for five passengers, a 650 kilograms (1,430 lb) load capacity and is currently manufactured in both a 1.6 and 2.0 litre variant. However motoring.com.au has indicated that a smaller 1.2 litre version could also be made available in European territories. The South American Oroch is currently offered with an array of options including a rear sports bar, soft cargo cover, fog lights, side steps, cargo extension and cabin protection bars.
