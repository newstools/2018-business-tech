MTN has announced that it will be giving customers 1GB of free data for downloading its MyMTN app, on 8 August. The promotion aims to draw attention to its social bundles which will be available through the app. The 1GB promotional offer will be available from 8 August to 31 December 2018 and will be valid for one day and will be activated within 24 hours of the download, MTN said. Customers will be notified when the 1GB has been activated. MTN’s social bundles will continue to be available on the app for all customers, and from mid-August, MTN’s personalised *142# menu will become the only channel to access social bundles for qualifying customers. The MyMTN app is free to use, and can be downloaded from Google Play Store, Apple Store, Windows Phone Store and Blackberry World. Other features of the app allow users to top up airtime, manage their mobile accounts, monitor their data usage, pay their bills and buy products and services easily from their mobile phones.
