South Africans have long been among the leading foreign purchasers of residential property in Mauritius, according to statistics by the Mauritian Board of Investments – largely to take advantage of the various residency programmes offered by Mauritius. Nico van Zyl, director at Sovereign Trust (Mauritius), said recent amendments to rules around foreign ownership of property – which mean that foreigners can now purchase commercial property, as well as certain residential properties – have only added to the popularity of the country as an investment destination. “Many South Africans are looking at setting up headquarters or satellite offices in Mauritius, both for the tax incentives and access to the qualified, yet affordable, local workforce,” said van Zyl. “Establishing a new business in Mauritius is extremely easy, with quick and efficient processes and no requirement for local partnership.” When looking at property prices, many of the homes and apartments on sale across the island compare also favourably with similar properties in Cape Town and Johannesburg.
