Renault South Africa has announced that its new Megane RS will be available to purchase in South Africa from mid-September. First announced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2017, the RS features a new generation 1.8-litre turbo engine, delivering 205kW and 390Nm. This modern engine, equipped with a chain-driven timing system, will also offer reduced CO2 emissions and fuel consumption, Renault said. The new Megane RS also boasts high-performance lighting – dubbed ‘RS Vision’ – which Renault says is unique in this market segment. Equipped with nine LED’s per block, this system combines four high-performance lighting functions: side lights, cornering lights, fog lights and long-range high beam lights. Other impressive new features include: Multi-Sense – this allows you to customise your sports car experience, by controlling engine response, the mapping of the accelerator pedal, shift patterns and the stiffness of the steering.
R-Link 2 – this is a modern control centre that manages the vehicle’s various connectivity functions: Multimedia, integrated navigation, telephone, radio, Multi-Sense, 4Control and driving aids for example.
RS Monitor – gathers and summarises information from sensors spread around the car.
Driving aids – including parking distance control, hill start assist, and cruise control with speed limiter.  Pricing Megane Expression 84kW – R274,900
