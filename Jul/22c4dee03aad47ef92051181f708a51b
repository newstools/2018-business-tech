The ANC has confirmed that a number of its staff members will be trained by Communist Party of China officials ahead of next year’s elections. According to a report by the Sunday Times, secretary-general Ace Magashule stated at a recent elections communications strategy workshop that this would include a large number of the party’s communications staff. In addition, more than 300 officials who will undergo training at the  Communist Party leadership training academy, he said. “He said we could learn a lot from the Chinese on issues of strategy and propaganda; that is why they are bringing officials from the CPC to South Africa,” said an insider who attended the meeting, and asked not to be named. ANC spokesman Pule Mabe confirmed that the party was looking at the CPC for assistance, but said it was not necessarily taking propaganda lessons from the Chinese. Mabe noted that from time to time it did send members to the party school in China, but in this instance Magashule was merely talking about boosting cooperation between the two countries, and that the partnership would extend beyond the elections. However the Sunday Times highlighted that it was not made clear exactly what lessons the ANC seeks to learn from China – as the country is a one-party state. It added that under the CPC there is limited media freedom, with the state controlling mainstream media. These concerns were echoed by ANC elections head Fikile Mbalula, who told the Sunday Times that the party could learn nothing from the CPC in terms of propaganda and strategy. “Why would we look to China for propaganda when they are an undemocratic state?” he said. “Our relationship with China is about strengthening ties in building a new world order.” Read: It’s final – e-tolls will be scrapped: ANC
