South Africa’s hotly contested bakkie market has seen the addition of several high end models in the first half of 2018, with the recent launch of the Mercedes X-Class a highlight. The luxury model is unlikely to challenge the country’s two runaway success stories in this market however – Toyota Hilux and Ford Ranger. The latest  data from Naamsa’s June new vehicle sales shows that Toyota Hilux (3,936) has opened up a significant lead over Ford Ranger (2,613) over the past month, although it needs to be pointed out that these figures count single cab units too. Data published by Lightstone at the start of the year showed that the Ranger and Hilux topped the best-sellers list in 2017, combining for more nearly 70,000 units. One of the most significant findings by Lightstone is that since the beginning of January 2015, through to the end of 2017, 41% of all double cabs sold in Southern Africa were Ford Rangers.
