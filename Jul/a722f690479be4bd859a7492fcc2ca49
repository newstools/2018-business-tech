Cisco has appointed Clayton Naidoo as the new GM for sub-Saharan Africa, based out of the Johannesburg office. In his role, Naidoo will oversee the implementation of Cisco’s strategy in the region, executing a vision that delivers transformational value to customers and partners. He will also develop strategic relationships across the entire ecosystem to drive a digital agenda for sub-Saharan Africa. “Clayton Naidoo’s appointment is opportune as Cisco builds momentum at the forefront of digital transformation efforts for governments and businesses in Africa,”  said David Meads, Cisco vice-president for Africa and Middle East. “There is huge potential for the region to reap benefits from helping customers and partners create value in a connected, digital world; unlocking new revenue streams; delivering better customer and citizen service; and creating employment.” Naidoo joined Cisco in 2007 and was most recently head of digital transformation with a particular focus on the public sector and large enterprise clients.
