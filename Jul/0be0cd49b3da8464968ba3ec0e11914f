Online job aggregator Adzuna has released a new report focusing on the rarest skills and jobs in South Africa. The report is based on over 140,000 job listings and 1,250,000 job seeker searches, and calculates the ‘rareness factor’ based on the number of job adverts asking for certain skills vs the number of job searchers who claim to have those skills. Technology (programmers, IT, etc) and financial skills topped the rankings for 2018, while there was a surprising drop in the rarity of engineering skills. “Either engineers are more abundant, which is doubtful, or for some reason less engineering skills are being advertised for,” said Jesse Green, country manager for Adzuna South Africa. However, he noted that the average salaries for engineers have remained high. “Civil engineers, in particular, have come in at over R628,000 on average, quite unchanged since September 2017 with only a 3% increase since then, mostly matching inflation,” he said. “In fact, while the rarity of skills may have changed, salaries are overall much more stable. “Only sales managers have see a correlation in rarity and salary increase. Sales management skills are 123% rarer and have seen a 12% average salary increase over the past 8 months.” He added that registered nurses have also seen a massive increase in demand and ‘rareness’. “The emigration of 20-30% of the nursing workforce (according to scientific journal papers published between 2001 and 2015) has had an impact on this sector of the job market,” he said. “However, the exodus of these skills is decreasing, which should see a reprieve to the numbers, which is not the case. Also, although nursing skills are rarer, the salaries have not improved much, only going up by 4% since last September.” Read: 8 ‘green’ jobs to look out for – and how much they pay in South Africa
