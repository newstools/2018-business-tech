The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has released its latest statistics focusing on customs busts for the period 1 January until 30 June 2018. Acting chief officer for customs and excise, Beyers Theron, congratulated his officers for their successes, but noted that there was more that customs and SARS could do to make inroads into the illicit economy. “We need to start looking at trends and patterns and becoming more strategic in the way we are dealing with some of these risks,” he said. He added that compared with the same period last year (January to June 2017), the number and value of busts has increased this year – with 4,122 busts valued at R1.73 billion this year, compared to 1,763 busts valued at R1.65 billion last year. According to SARS, the total value of all goods confiscated amounts to R1.73 billion.
