As South Africa prepares for its fifth consecutive petrol price, industries around the country are starting to feel the pinch. This includes Uber drivers who recently asked the company to increase fare prices to help stem their losses. This culminated in a strike and a handing over of a memorandum from a number of its ‘driver-partners’ at the beginning of July. In response, Uber said that it would not increase fee prices, but would instead introduce a number of incentives to cover the cost of the most recent petrol increases for June and July. While these drivers contend with the rising fuel price, they also face competition from metered taxis and other lifting services such as Taxify, which threaten to eat into their business. Below BusinessTech looked at a comparison of the pricing between Uber and Taxify in and around the Johannesburg region. In comparing the two, we looked at the pricing as provided for in the Uber fare estimator as well as pricing quoted by Taxify’s mobile app. Note: These fares are estimates only and do not reflect variations due to discounts, surge pricing, or other factors. Flat rates and minimum fares may also apply.  Read: Uber drivers go on strike in South Africa over fuel prices
