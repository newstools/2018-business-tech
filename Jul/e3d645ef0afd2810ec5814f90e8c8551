The Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU) at the University of Cape Town (UCT) has developed an income comparison tool to show how income is distributed – from the poorest to the richest in the country. “In four easy clicks, you can find out where you are in South Africa’s income distribution and how you compare to the rest of the population,” it said. Compare your salary here. “Most people are wrong about where they are located in the income distribution. This tool was designed to help people understand the nature and extent of South Africa’s inequality,” said SALDRU.  BankservAfrica recently published its latest Take-Home Pay Index (BTPI) for May 2018, showing the average salary wis R14,290 in current terms, down 1.3% from May 2017. In real terms, the average salary was R13,621, R290 less than for April 2018, BankservAfrica said. “Salary payments through our system indicate that the typical take-home pay was actually closer to R10,730 in May, which showed an increase of 2.8% before inflation from the typical take-home salary of R10,010 in constant 2016 terms. However, with inflation, typical salaries declined with 1.5%,” the group said. Data published late last month by Stats SA, showed that the average monthly earnings paid to employees in the formal non-agricultural sector decreased from R20,060 in November 2017 to R19,858 in February 2018 – though this was up 5% year on year from R18,913 in February 2017. Expressed as an annual salary, this equates to R238,300 a year. SALDRU pointed out that it is not the first organisation to develop an income comparison tool. The Guardian newspaper, also developed an income tool that enables people to see how wealthy they are compared to their fellow countrymen, while the Institute for Fiscal Studies recently launched a similar tool. The OECD also developed a global income comparison tool and CNNMoney has a global wage calculator. Read: Here’s the average take-home pay in South Africa right now
