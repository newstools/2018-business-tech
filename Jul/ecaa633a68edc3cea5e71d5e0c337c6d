South Africa’s tax season for individuals officially opened on Sunday for eFilers, with branches around the country accepting submissions from Monday (2 July). One of the key changes this year is the shortening of the deadline for non-provisional taxpayers. “A shorter filing season allows additional time for SARS, taxpayers and the tax fraternity to deal with return verifications before most taxpayers go on the December holiday break,” SARS said in a statement in June. “Often there are delays with taxpayers having to respond to our queries and requests over the holiday break. The quiet period after the first three months of tax season has now been removed resulting in efficient use of our resources,” it added. The revised deadlines are as follows: As part of the launch, SARS also published a number of helpful tips and changes to be aware of before filing. BusinessTech looked at these, and other things that you need to know when submitting this year’s return. Who doesn’t need to submit? According to SARS, you do not need to submit a return if all the criteria below apply to you: Your total employment income/salary for the year (March 2017 to February 2018) before tax (gross income) was not more than R350,000; and
You only received employment income/salary for the full year of assessment (March 2017 to February 2018) from one employer; and
You have no car allowance/company car/travel allowance or other income (e.g. interest or rental income); and
You are not claiming tax related deductions/rebates (e.g. medical expenses, retirement annuity contributions other than pension contributions made by your employer, travel).
