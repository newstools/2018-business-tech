Amazon.com is expanding its presence in South Africa as it looks to continue its regional battle with cloud computing rival Microsoft. According to a report by Reuters, Amazon is set to be the sole tenant in a new, modern eight-story office building that’s due for completion in August. The company is also advertising a number of jobs in Cape Town, which played a key role in the early development of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing business, said Reuters. “As more South African customers and partners continue to choose AWS as their cloud provider we continue to hire more staff into our offices in Cape Town and Johannesburg,” Geoff Brown, AWS’ Sub-Saharan Africa regional manager, told Reuters in a statement. A look at its official jobs portal shows 77 full-time positions open, with jobs advertised in categories that include everything from software development to customer service. Most of the job postings feature a list of basic and preferred qualifications, as well as an in-depth description of the duties you are expected to perform in the role. Amazon also notes that it is an equal opportunities employer, and welcomes applications from all members of society irrespective of age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, race, religion or belief. “Amazon is strongly committed to diversity within its community and especially welcomes applications from South African citizens who are members of designated groups who may contribute to Employment Equity within the workplace and the further diversification of ideas,” it added.
