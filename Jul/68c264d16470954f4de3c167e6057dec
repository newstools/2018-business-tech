The popularity of bakkies in South Africa, and around the world, has led to a number of manufacturers introducing luxury features and models. However, the rise of upmarket dual-cabs and their luxury features will never come at the cost of load-carrying ability or practicality. This is according to senior global design executive for Toyota, Kevin Hunter, who was speaking in a recent interview with Australian car site motoring.co.au. Hunter added that rivals including Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Ford will likely adhere to this same line of thinking in the future. “It seems like buyers are turning away from SUVs and premium crossovers and looking instead at premium trucks. We can’t even build enough Tundra TRDs to satisfy the demand,” Hunter said, referring to Toyota’s full-sized ‘pick-up’ in the US. “We have a really rugged truck image in the US and we’re aiming to keep that. We want to build on what we have, especially in the US. Those trucks are built on a work-truck reputation, along with hard-core off-roading – that’s what we’re aiming for.” This way of thinking aligns with South Africa, as local motorists also favour ‘work-horse’ like bakkies according to Naamsa’s latest monthly data. Familiar models continue to feature at the top of the list, with the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, and economically friendly Nissan NP200 making up the top three.
