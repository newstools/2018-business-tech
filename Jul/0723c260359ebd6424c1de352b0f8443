The EFF is currently working on new proposed legislation to end the outsourcing of all government workers at the local, provincial and national level. In a statement released to congratulate the DA on its plans to in-source 1,600 security workers in Johannesburg, the EFF said that the draft legislation was in line with its commitment to to have secure and quality work for all workers. While no further details were provided on the proposed legislation, the EFF’s Floyd Shivambu took to Twitter on Monday afternoon (2 July) to confirm that the legislation was close to completion. “The EFF is drafting and will soon gazette the Insourcing of National, Provincial, and Local Government and Entities’ Employees Act,” he said. “This will bring dignity and honour to all government employees, particularly security guards, cleaners and all general workers.” The issue of in-sourcing workers has grown to become an increasingly important talking point for South Africa’s political parties in recent years, with the DA stating that its move to in-source security personnel in Johannesburg would save it a significant amount of money – which can then be passed on directly to employees. “Previously, the security services were outsourced through over 150 contracts with service providers paying an average of R14,000 per security guard, while the guards received as little as R4,000 as a basic salary per month,” the DA said. The new system implemented by the City now means that the security personnel will not only receive an increased income, but will also have access to benefits like: Medical Aid;
