Absa, in association with Samsung South Africa, will soon be offering its customers early access to Samsung Pay before the service is commercially launched in South Africa. Samsung Pay is an application which lets you store bank card details on a device, and pay merchants by tapping or ‘swiping’ your smartphone rather than a physical bank card. The app lets you make payments via Magnetic Secure Transmission, which mimics the magnetic stripe on the back of your card. It can also use NFC technology in contactless cards for ‘tap-and-go’ payments. In a statement released on Friday (27 July), the bank said that early access will be open to all Absa customers in South Africa and will be available on the Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+, Note 8, S8, S8+, S7, S7 Edge, and A8. It added that support for the Samsung A5/A7 (2017 Edition) will arrive at a later date. Absa said that selected customers will be invited to join the early access program over the coming days, however it noted that it would never contact them directly via sms or emails (phishing) to register for Samsung Pay using hyperlinks and attachments provided in the sms or email. MyBroadband reported this week that the Samsung Pay app is live in the Google Play store in South Africa. Although the service does not appear to be active, it displayed a page which stated that Standard Bank will also be a local launch partner. Absa CEO, Maria Ramos noted earlier this month that the bank aims to win back market share through digital channels. “We are determined to to build a sustainable digitally led business,” Ramos said.
