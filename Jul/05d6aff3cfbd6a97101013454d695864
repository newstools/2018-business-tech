The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has announced that it will be increasing taxi fares, following the recent fuel price hikes. In a statement released on Tuesday (31 July), the organisation said the increases were set to take place from 1 August 2018, with all local and long distance operations increasing by between R1 – R10 and R1 – R20 respectively. It added that these increases may be more in some areas. “Santaco’s highest decision-making body‚ Management Council (Manco)‚ has decided at its specially convened meeting that taxi fares for local and long-distance operations will increase‚” the organisation said. “For the January 2017 until January 2018 period alone the petrol price has increased with 130%. There was a further fuel levy increase in 2018. Santaco has therefore decided the August 2018 increases will only be valid until June 2019‚ when they will be reviewed.” “Santaco regrets the impact of these increases on the commuters‚ especially the poor‚ but unless they are effected‚ many taxi operators will struggle to stay in business and consequently offer this much-needed service.” In a statement on Monday, the Department of Energy said that hard pressed motorists will have to contend with a petrol price increase of one cent a litre on Wednesday. Both Grades of 93 and 95 (ULP and LRP) will rise by a cent. This will take a litre of 95 from R16.02 to R16.03 in Gauteng. Read: Petrol price to increase on Wednesday
