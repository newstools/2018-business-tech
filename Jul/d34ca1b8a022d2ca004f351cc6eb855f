Mobile operator Cell C has announced new WhatsApp bundles, which now include access to Facebook. Based on the original WhatsApp bundle, Cell C said that its three new bundles in the ‘ShoutOut’ range will also include access to Facebook – doubling the number of platforms that customers can use these bundles for. “We are taking the top two social apps, WhatsApp and Facebook, and giving customers access at incredible rates, from as little as R4 per day for an 80MB bundle. We know customers will be excited by these new bundles as they will allow them to stay connected across their two favourite social apps,” said Cell C chief commercial officer, Junaid Munshi. Cell C said it has doubled the data for WhatsApp bundles for only R2 more. That means that for only R17, customers will now get 1200MB to use on both WhatsApp and Facebook for 30 days with ShoutOut R17. Cell C has also expanded its suite of offers to address growing customer demand by catering to a more diverse audience. ShoutOut R4 provides customers an inexpensive daily option to access WhatsApp and Facebook. The bundle is valid for 24 hours and allows customers up to 80MB to access the two platforms. This offer, it said, has been designed to provide customers more disposable income for those seeking greater value amidst tougher economic times. Read: Cell C rolls out new logo and corporate colours
