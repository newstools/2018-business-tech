The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is now, along with the National Prosecuting Authority, prosecuting taxpayers who have not filed their tax returns. If your returns are not up to date, it would be a good idea to get them up to date as soon as possible, advises Daniel Baines, author of How to Get a SARS Refund and tax consultant at Mazars. The easiest way to file your tax returns is on Efiling. If you do not have an Efiling profile then you should go to the SARS Efiling website and set one up. If you have an Efiling profile but you have forgotten your username and password, you will need to phone the SARS contact centre and get this sorted. On Efiling, you must take the following steps in order to file your outstanding tax returns: If you are unsure of which returns you have submitted, you can go to the ‘Returns History’ tab; this should display all your tax returns submitted for the last while (if you have submitted your returns at a SARS branch then it may not show on this page). If you have now submitted all your returns up to date, you may still have the issue of SARS having levied a non-compliance penalty for non-submission of returns. To check whether a non-compliance penalty has been levied you can do the following: If you have submitted all your tax returns up to date and do not owe SARS any income tax, you can (with good reasons) request a remission of this penalty. To check whether you owe income tax to SARS, you can check your statement of account under the ‘SARS Correspondence’ and ‘Request Historic IT Notices’ tabs. This should also show you which returns have been submitted, Baines said. Read: What to do if SARS does not pay out your tax refund
