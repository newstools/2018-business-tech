Duduzane Zuma – son of former president Jacob Zuma – is expected to surrender himself over to the Hawks this week following his alleged involvement in the Gupta plot to bribe former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas. Law enforcement authorities are also understood to be considering charging Duduzane in connection with the Estina dairy project, in which Gupta companies stand accused of fraudulently receiving millions of rands intended for poor black farmers in the Free State, reports the Sunday Times. Zuma’s lawyer Rudi Krause said that he had assured the Hawks that Duduzane would present himself at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Johannesburg this week, and that it would not be necessary to arrest him. While both Zuma and the Guptas were reported to have fled the country before being formally charged, it is believed that Zuma returned to South Africa to attend the funeral of his brother Vusi. Former president Jacob Zuma is said to have advised against his son’s return to the country, with insiders telling the Sunday Times that the charges against Duduzane would be the realisation of his father’s “worst nightmare”. Duduzane is also expected to appear in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court this week to face culpable homicide charges relating to his role in a 2014 car crash.
