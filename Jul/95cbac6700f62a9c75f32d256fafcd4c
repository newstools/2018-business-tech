The City of Johannesburg has issued an advisory to residents, with construction on the Watt Street Interchange project scheduled to begin this month. The development forms part of the construction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, the city said. “The most affected stakeholders are along the Wynberg precinct, as a result of the road closing along the M11 Pretoria Main Road, from Arkwright Avenue to Thora Crescent Avenue. “To minimise the impact caused to the public, road users and pedestrians are urged to please be aware that traffic diversions will take place in this area from Thursday, 5 July 2018, with an anticipated construction period of 18 months,” it said. The construction, which is estimated to cost approximately R260 million, will include: The demolishing of the existing bridge and the interchange at Watt Street;
The construction of the new east-west link from Rautenbach Avenue to Watt Street, an upgrade intersection on Pretoria Main Road;
The construction of new BRT lanes and station The city said that the interchange forms part of the Rea Vaya BRT System Phase 1C, which includes the section 8 trunk route from Sandton to Alexandra along Rivonia and Katherine Drives, and the section 15 trunk route from Parktown in Johannesburg to Alexandra along Louis Botha Avenue. “The city is confident that, through the project, residents along Pretoria Main Road and adjacent areas will have a safe commuting environment, less congestion, as well as a healthy lifestyle,” it said.
