Henley & Partners, an investment migration firm, has won the public tender to design, implement, and promote the Moldova Citizenship-by-Investment (MCBI) programme. The MCBI programme, set to launch within the next few months, will become the third such programme in Europe — after Malta and Cyprus —and the most affordable, giving individuals the opportunity to acquire alternative citizenship by making a €100,000 (R1.57 million) contribution to Moldova’s Public Investment Fund. “The programme is poised for success on account of its competitive pricing structure and strong value proposition,” said Marco Gantenbein, Executive Committee member at Henley & Partners. “Moldova offers its citizens visa-free access to 121 destinations, including the countries in Europe’s Schengen Area as well as Russia and Turkey. It has entered into an association agreement with the EU and is aiming to become a candidate country for EU membership.” Moldova’s minister of economy and infrastructure, Chiril Gaburici, said his government’s primary objective is to create long-lasting societal value for the Moldovan people. “The MCBI programme will provide our economy with valuable FDI that will enhance the daily lives of all Moldovans. Uncompromising due diligence standards and compliance procedures will guarantee the credibility, competitiveness, and long-term sustainability of the programme. “In this regard, we are delighted to be working with Henley & Partners, whose good governance systems are industry-leading.” According to the programme’s website, “this regime will benefit foreign citizens who will invest in the Sustainable Development Fund at least €100,000 or €250,000 in the areas of strategic development (e.g. Real Estates Investment, Government Bonds). “The timeframe for the examination of the application will be 30 days according to the government. The total period until the applicant holds his new passport and officially recognized the Moldovan citizenship is estimated to be 1-3 months.” The three options to buy into Moldova come with the following additional costs: Donation (€100,000) Additional fees: €7,500 Application fee
