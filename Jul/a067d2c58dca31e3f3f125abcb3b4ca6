Airbnb has announced the the launch of ‘experiences’ in Johannesburg – with around 30 experiences already available on the platform. Experiences are activities or excursions that are led by local hosts, highlighting their interests and perspective as well as unique places many visitors might not otherwise get to experience. “The experiences in Johannesburg show the vibrancy of the City of Gold. From urban farming, to the real Soweto, to some of the best nightlife spots – travellers can truly immerse themselves in one of Africa’s most energetic cities through experiences,” said Velma Corcoran, country manager for Airbnb South Africa. “The expansion of experiences across all of South Africa will help to boost tourism outside of city centres by attracting more people to rural and regional areas. “Experiences help spread the benefits of hosting to those who do not have space in their house to rent out. This is also a fantastic way for visitors and locals to experience parts of South Africa that they would otherwise miss, had it not been for these passionate locals,” said Corcoran. Also on offer in Johannesburg are social impact experiences where 100% of the proceeds benefit the hosting organisation, while Airbnb forgoes its usual fee. Around 30% of experiences booked in South Africa are social impact experiences that support different associations and NGOs. Training with boxing grannies is one of those available to be booked on the platform. Hosted by the A-Team Foundation, the experience helps promote fitness and bodybuilding in underserved areas and hosting an experience on Airbnb raises funds to renew training material and pay the fitness trainers. BusinessTech looked at this, and some of the other experiences currently available on the platform below.
