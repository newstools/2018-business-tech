MTN has confirmed that a technical error is currently impacting a small percentage of its customers. A number of users took to social media on Friday morning (20 July) after complaining that their account balances reflected zero. The users stated that both their data and airtime accounts reflected an amount of R0.00, while some users noted that they were unable to recharge their accounts. Others stated that data specific bundles such as MTN”s Night Surfer and WhatsApp bundles were also impacted and no longer reflected as part of their account balances. In a tweet sent out on Friday, the company said that the error was impacting recharging, current balances and the number of customer minutes reflected. It added that finding the resolution was a priority and that all balances and services would be restored before the end of the day as technicians work on the issue.
