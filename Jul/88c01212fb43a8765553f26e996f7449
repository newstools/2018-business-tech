The UK government has updated its risk advisory for South Africa. As with earlier advisories, the UK government cautioned about the drought facing the Cape Town region, the very high levels of crime including rape and murder, and regular protest action in the country. Aimed at providing information to its citizens regarding any possible dangers they may face when travelling to the country, the most recent update also cautions about the discovery of incendiary devices at Durban shopping centres. “As of July 2018, police are investigating a series of incendiary devices placed at different locations in the Durban area,” it said. “Two of these devices were triggered, causing small fires. You should exercise usual caution if you encounter unexpected devices or packages. If in doubt, contact the police.” Separately, the UK government also warned that terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in South Africa. “Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as shopping areas in major cities,” it said. “The main threat is from extremists linked to Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). In February 2018, two South African-British nationals were kidnapped.” It added that South African authorities have successfully disrupted several planned attacks and made a number of arrests related to terrorism offences including alleged plots to attack Jewish targets and western diplomatic missions.
