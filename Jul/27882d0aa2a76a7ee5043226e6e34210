Netflix South Africa has released a new video which seems to poke fun at its ongoing rivalry with DStv. The video features local comedian Jason Goliath as a ‘Netflix installation technician’, highlighting the fact that the streaming service has no installation process and minimum start-up requirements – unlike its local competitor. The advert escalates as Goliath attempts to justify the ‘hard work’ which goes in to the installation process, setting up multiple Netflix accounts and Premium HD subscriptions. One group that is unlikely to see the funny side of the advert is DStv, who has released a series of statements focusing on the unfair competitive advantage Netflix currently has in the country. Multichoice South Africa CEO, Calvo Mawela told MyBroadband in a recent interview that the current regulatory regime is focused on traditional pay-TV services, and does not look at streaming players like Netflix. He said there is a need for a regulatory change to catch up with technological advances – and this was not only the view of MultiChoice, but most local stakeholders. He highlighted that MultiChoice is adapting to the changing entertainment landscape with its own streaming products, which include Showmax and DStv Now. Mawela welcomed the increased competition from other players, but said it is not fair that DStv must adhere to numerous regulations – while a competitor like Netflix is unregulated. The points raised by Mawela include the fact Netflix does not pay local taxes, does not have local employees, and does not have to adhere to local content or BEE requirements.
