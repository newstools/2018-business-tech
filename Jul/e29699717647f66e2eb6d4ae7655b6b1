Former US president Barack Obama will deliver the 2018 Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in Johannesburg on Tuesday, to mark the 100th anniversary of the anti-apartheid leader’s birth. The address is expected to attract up to 10,000 people to the Wanderers Stadium, in Sandton. Obama is set to reflect on Mandela’s example of perseverance and vision and what lessons we can we draw from his legacy. The lecture’s theme will be “Renewing the Mandela Legacy and Promoting Active Citizenship in a Changing World.” Instead of commenting on politics, Obama’s speech will draw on broader themes and his admiration for Mandela, whom America’s first black president saw as a mentor, Associated Press said. It also marks the start of ‘Mandela Day’ celebrations, being the day before Nelson Mandela’s birthday, which is noted across the world as a day to inspire change. It also forms part of the Obama Foundation’s Leaders: Africa project, which is a year-long initiative to inspire, empower, and connect 200 emerging leaders from across Africa to take on the biggest challenges in their communities, countries, and continent. Following the lecture on Tuesday, Obama will host a town hall with 200 emerging leaders from 44 African nations on Mandela Day (18 July), where the foundation will exchange ideas and look for solutions to the biggest challenges facing Africa. The lecture will start at 13h00 local time. You can watch the live stream right here:  You can also watch at one of these pages: Obama Foundation Live Stream
