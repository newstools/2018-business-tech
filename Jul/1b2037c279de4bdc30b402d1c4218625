The City of Tshwane has entered into a service agreement with Telkom/BCX which will see all councillors for the city receiving a cell phone with unlimited data. In a statement, the city said that the agreement commenced on 27 June and is set to remain in place for the next three years. “The nature of their jobs is the main reason why the city decided to provide its councillors with cell phone allowances. Councillors deal with issues that affect community members and they sometimes run out of airtime and data when they have to escalate issues or address emergency matters,” the city said. It added that the service will ensure that councillors have enough airtime and data to execute their duties effectively and efficiently. “Councillors work directly with national and provincial departments, and they have to call heads of departments regularly to get information that will benefit residents. Through this agreement, councillors will be able to communicate with residents regarding issues of service delivery,” it said. The city said that Telkom was chosen over other competitors, based on the package and pricing that was offered. Read: Telkom appoints new chief financial officer
