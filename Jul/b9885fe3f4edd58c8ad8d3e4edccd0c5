Absa has launched its brand redesign, showing off a new logo and colour scheme as part of its shift from a European-owned financial group to a proudly African firm. As part of its presentation on Wednesday (11 July), Absa explained that the redesign would include hundreds of thousands of changes – with everything from clothing to pens now featuring the new logo.
