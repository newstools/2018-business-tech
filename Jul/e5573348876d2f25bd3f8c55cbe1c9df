PwC’s latest executive director’s remuneration and practices report shows an increase in executive pay for those at the helm of JSE-listed companies over the past year. Information was extracted from the annual reports of 359 (2017: 360) actively trading companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) during the 2017 reporting period, which had a total market capitalisation of R14.5 trillion (2017: R14.0 trillion), the auditing and advisory firm said. The data used in the report was drawn from information publicly available for the 12-month reporting period ended 30 April 2018 (the 2017 reporting period). PwC noted that the dominant sector is industrials (34.5%), followed by services (25.7%), financial services (21.1%), and basic resources (17.4%). Preference shares and Alt-X make up 1.1% and 0.1% respectively, it said. At the cut-off date, just 31 JSE-listed companies (2017: 33) accounted for 80% of the market’s capitalisation. Large-caps hold 84% (2017: 83%), medium-caps 12% (2017: 12%) and small-caps 4% (2017: 5%). The top-100 companies, comprising large- and medium-caps, account for 90% (2017: 95%) of the total invested capital on the JSE, PwC said. The average inflation in South Africa for the 2017 reporting period, after consumer inflation rebasing and re-weighting for the reporting period was 5.3% (2016: 6.6%).
