Adjustments: 93 ULP and LRP – 26 cents per litre increase
95 ULP and LRP – 23 cents per litre increase

Diesel 0.005% Sulphur – 24 cents per litre increase
Illuminating Paraffin (wholesale) – 22 cents per litre increase
LP Gas – 37.00 c/kg increase The department attributed the increase to the rand/US dollar exchange rate, decrease in the prices of crude oil and the import prices of petroleum products. “The rand’s movements were mainly influenced by global factors. The market has started to become worried about the effect that the trade war between the USA and China will have on the global economy. “The main reason for the lower crude oil prices is that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies agreed to increase production in order to retake market share from rivals and to calm prices to avoid blunting demand growth during their meeting on 22nd June 2018,” said the department. The fuel prices schedule for the different zones will be published on Tuesday, 03 July 2018. This is what you can expect to pay: Read: What happens to Uber rates when the petrol price increases?
