Apple has announced an updated MacBook Pro with faster performance and new pro features. The new MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar feature 8th-generation Intel Core processors, with 6-core on the 15-inch model for up to 70% faster performance, and quad-core on the 13-inch model for up to two times faster performance. This makes it ideal for manipulating large data sets, performing complex simulations, creating multi-track audio projects or doing advanced image processing or film editing, the company said in a statement on Thursday (12 July). Apple said that the new MacBook Pro can compile code faster and run multiple virtual machines and test environments easier than before. “Additional updates include support for up to 32GB of memory, a True Tone display and an improved third-generation keyboard for quieter typing,” it said. “The latest generation MacBook Pro is the fastest and most powerful notebook we’ve ever made,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Now with 8th-generation 6-core processors, up to 32GB of system memory, up to 4TB of super fast SSD storage, new True Tone technology in its Retina display and Touch Bar, the Apple T2 chip for enhanced security and a third-generation quieter keyboard packed into its thin and light aluminium design with all-day battery life, it’s the best notebook for pro users.” The smaller MacBook Pro starts at $1,799 and the larger model at $2,399. Both are available starting Thursday on the company’s website and in some Apple retail stores and authorised resellers later this week.    Read: Gap widens between Samsung and Apple
