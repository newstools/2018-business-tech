Two senior management service officials in the Department of Energy continued to receive a salary despite being suspended for almost an entire year, at a cost of R2.6 million. Fin24 reported that Energy minister Jeff Radebe told Parliament that the matter related to declaring business interests with the state – something banned by the Public Administration Management Act in 2014. Radebe was replying to a written question from Freedom Front Plus MP Anton Alberts. He said all the senior management service members declared their financial interests for the year 2017/ 2018, barring three. Fin24 reported that the minister pointed to an ‘oversight from the officials’ who missed the concession deadline of 31 May 2018. Alberts asked how many senior management service members were on paid suspension, to which Radebe replied that two were suspended with full pay. “There are currently two officials that are suspended on full salary. Both the employees are on post level 15. “One employee was suspended on 19 May 2017, which is a total of 396 days. The other was suspended on 27 July 2017, which is a total of 327 days,” said Radebe. The minister said that the costs amounted to R1,453,379.62 and R1,234,357.92, for each of the two officials. Read: How much money ministers, deputies, MPs, Kings and Queens will get paid in 2018
