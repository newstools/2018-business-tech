The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) recently launched a new public awareness campaign alongside the introduction of the new Mandela commemorative series of banknotes and R5 circulation coin. As part of the campaign, the SARB released a series of videos to highlight what makes the notes and coin special, as well as a number of security features implemented in the notes. Dubbed ‘check-check’, the SARB said it was important to check that your commemorative banknotes are real when using them for transactions. You can find these videos, as well as an explanation of these security features detailed below. Coin The Reserve Bank said that there are two main components to check when  dealing with the commemorative coin. The first is that the ‘1918’ on the face of the coin should change to ‘2018’ when viewing it at an angle. The second security feature is to check whether you can see ‘SARB’ and ‘R5’ inscribed on the outer edge of the coin. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Notes Compared to the coin, there are a number of more noticeable security features included on the commemorative notes.
