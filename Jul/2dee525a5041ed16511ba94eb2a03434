The ANC in Gauteng says it plans to do away with e-tolls, after Premier David Makhura was on Friday elected unopposed as the ruling party’s provincial chairman in the province. This is according to a report from African News Agency (ANA), citing newly elected ANC provincial secretary Jacob Khawe. This [ANC provincial] conference made the call that e-tolls must go… we say away with e-tolls, away. We also call on government to look into the high cost of living, which has shot up high,” Khawe said. “We must say no to corruption… we must say no to state capture. We also commit ourselves to to ensuring an overwhelming victory for the ANC at the 2019 election,” he said. Bloomberg reported that in power since the end of white-majority rule in 1994, the ANC has seen its support wane over the past decade. The party won its fifth national election in 2014 with 62% of the vote but suffered its worst performance in the 2016 local-government vote when it lost control of major cities including the capital Pretoria, and the economic hub Johannesburg – both in Gauteng. The 106-year-old party is seeking to win back the confidence of voters next year to retain control of Gauteng. Makhura conceded in his state of the province address back in February that the e-toll system was simply not working, and that he would approach Ramaphosa to discuss solutions. “We all know that the e-tolls have added to the cost of living for many motorists and public transport users in Gauteng. The new dawn (leadership change) must also bring a solution to the protracted and unresolved problem of e-tolls,” Makhura said at the time. Read: E-tolls have failed: ANC
