UK-based credit brokers, Moneypod, has published new data showing the highest paid world leaders in 2018 – and how their salaries compare to their country’s national average wage. The researchers found that the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, makes over three times the amount of the second highest earning world leader in Hong Kong’s Carrie Lam – pocketing $1.7 million (R22 million) per year. UK prime minister Theresa May earns a reported $186,000, compared to Donald Trump’s $400,000 – although the latter only accepts $1 of his salary. Meanwhile, Norway’s prime minister Erna Solberg ($187,000), earns only $100,000 more than the average Norwegian worker due to country’s high average national income. South Africa South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa  earns a salary of R3.6 million in 2018 – easily making him one of the best paid leaders in the world. Converted to dollars (at current rates) Ramaphosa’s salary translates to just over $270,000 – putting him firmly among the top 10 highest paid leaders in the world depending on rand/dollar fluctuations. While Ramaphosa has previously indicated that he will give half of his salary to charity, South Africa’s presidential salary also stands out due to its disparity with the national average wage. According to the latest Stats SA data, average monthly earnings paid to employees in the formal non-agricultural sector decreased from R20,060 in November 2017 to R19,858 in February 2018 – though this was up 5% year on year from R18,913 in February 2017. Expressed as an annual salary, this equates to R238,300. A separate release from BankservAfrica showed that the average take-home salary is at R13,621 a month – or R163,450 a year.
