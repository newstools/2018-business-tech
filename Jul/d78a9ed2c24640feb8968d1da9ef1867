Construction is currently underway on the R10 billion Sky City development in the south-east of Johannesburg. Slated as one of the biggest private property developments in Gauteng, the new project is positioned on a portion of agricultural land just south of Katlehong known as Waterval. Targeted at lower to middle-income groups (R10,500 – R25,000 per month), the development will feature at least two affordably-priced private schools, as well as a number of churches, crèches, clinics, council and social facilities. Surrounded by large security perimeter walls, the development will also feature a number of parks as well as recreational facilities like jogging trails, jungle gyms and soccer fields. Sky City is also set to receive its own retail centre, with the Sky City Mall set to become the hub of the development. Slated to open at the end of April 2019, the mall will be developed in three phases – of which, phase 1 includes the convenience centre of 10,000 sqm, expanding into a regional mall of 32,000 sqm as the development progresses – serving approximately 181,000 people in the catchment area.

According to GMI, the mall will be anchored by a Shoprite and Cashbuild with considerable interest from key national retail outlets like Shoprite Liquor, Pep, Ackermans, Tekkie Town, KFC and AutoZone. It added that the site is ideally positioned for a filling station, and that is aiming to be fully occupied by the end of 2018. Read: Cape Town puts R8 billion foreshore development on standby
