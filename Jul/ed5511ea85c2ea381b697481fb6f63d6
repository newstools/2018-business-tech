South Africans may be able to travel to more countries visa-free in the coming years. This is according to Ryan Cummings, director of Signal Risk -a political and security risk-management consultancy based in South Africa – who was commenting on the release of the latest Henley & Partners Passport Index for 2018. He said that the implementation of widespread reforms at the Department of Home Affairs since 2014 – focused on improving security features both in the application process and within the passport document itself – is expected to enhance confidence in the South African passport and may relax visa restrictions for its holders going forward. “Other factors that could strengthen the South Africa passport over the short-to-medium-term include president Cyril Ramaphosa’s intention to ease visa restrictions for African passport holders so as to induce greater intra-Africa trade, in addition to his deployment of an economic envoy with the mandate of securing $100 billion in foreign direct investment.” While the promise of travelling to more countries is enticing to many South Africans, there are over 102 countries you can travel to visa-free right now – including a number of popular holiday and cultural destinations.
