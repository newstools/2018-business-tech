Businessman Michael Jordaan recently sat down with 702’s Bruce Whitfield for a series of podcasts focusing on great South African minds who are thinking differently and going against the norm. While Jordaan spoke about his upbringing in Pretoria and the Western Cape, one of the most interesting parts of the story dealt with his experience in applying for a job at Rand Merchant Bank. Shortly after starting his PhD thesis, Jordaan saw an advertisement for a Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) programme in the newspaper, which came in the form of a riddle.

Following a rigorous interview process, Jordaan landed a job as a trainee at RMB’s ‘Class Of’ programme, allowing him to be exposed to various parts of merchant banking – as well as a challenging, dynamic, and innovative culture at the company. Within ten years he was appointed CEO of First National Bank where he continued to make a name for himself as an innovative and creative thinker.
