The UK’s Home Secretary has announced a new UK visa route aimed at people looking to start their own business. Announced during London Tech Week, the ‘start-up’ visa is expected to launch in Spring 2019 and is specifically aimed at foreign entrepreneurs looking to move to the UK. UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javed said that the UK hopes to attract more business owners and entrepreneurs by creating accessible visa routes for foreigners. “The UK can be proud that we are a leading nation when it comes to tech and innovation, but we want to do more to attract businesses to the UK and our migration system plays a key part in that. That’s why I am pleased to announce a new visa for people wanting to start a business in the UK,” he said. Commenting on the new visa, Sable International’s John Dunn said that the one requirement (or lack thereof) that has caught everyone’s attention is the fact that you don’t need a university education to qualify for this visa. “Although the new visa won’t require the applicant to have a degree, it will require that you have an endorsement from either a university or an approved business sponsor,” he said. “The details of this endorsement have yet to be announced. The Home Office has said that they hope to make this visa application process faster and smoother for entrepreneurs coming to the UK.” Keeping in mind the effect of Brexit on net migration, the new visa will hopefully also contribute to dealing with the skills shortages that the UK is currently experiencing, as entrepreneurs play a key role in creating jobs and driving economic growth, he added.
