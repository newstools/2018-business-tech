Absa has published a brief teaser of its new corporate identity which is expected to be unveiled next week – hinting at a new logo. Following Barclays’ exit from the African and South African market, Absa – which was officially called Barclays Africa – announced that it would adopt Absa as its official named across all its operations. This marks a big change for the bank, which will once again become a wholly African financial group, and will be led in with a ‘relaunch’ of sorts, showcasing new branding across the group. The bank has remained tight-lipped about its new look, pointing only to a big announcement on 11 July. Sources close to the reveal project told BusinessTech that the company will keep red as its key brand colour. A new teaser published by the bank points to a variety of colours on the red-end of the colour spectrum. This is corroborated by the group’s offices in Johannesburg being painted to facilitate the new branding, featuring these hues. The teaser video also points to a probable change to the group’s logo. The group is also expected to adopt a new slogan with its rebranding exercise, which is said to open a “bold” new chapter at the company.  Read: Barclays Africa to change its name to Absa
