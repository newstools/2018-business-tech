Africa.com has completed its acquisition of iAfrica.com, South Africa’s oldest news portal, from Primedia and MTN. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed. iAfrica was founded in the late 1990s, and continues to serve as a news source. Africa.com chairman and CEO, Teresa Clarke, will serve as executive editor of iAfrica, whose content will continue to include a wide array of coverage of local and international news, business, sport, and lifestyle content. The acquisition builds on Africa.com’s strength in running the news site at www.africa.com, and the Africa.com Business Publishers Network, a group of nearly fifty business content publishers on the continent who have joined Africa.com to create a digital audience of over fifteen million influential business people. “The acquisition of iAfrica creates a next generation South African media platform with a global reach,” said Clarke. “By acquiring iAfrica, we are able to combine editorial, technology, and marketing resources, bringing the benefits of more original content and better site performance to readers of both iAfrica and Africa.com. Africa.com has already started its re-branding of the iAfrica.com news portal. “Africa.com is known for its creative content in the form of slideshows, videos, and infographics, and we will bring these content forms to iAfrica,” said Debra Winter, chief operating officer of Africa.com. Internet services with the “@iafrica.com” email address will continue to be operated by MWEB, a division of Internet Solutions Digital.
