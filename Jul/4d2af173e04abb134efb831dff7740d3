AutoTrader has compiled a list of the top 10 vehicles that would make for good first-time purchases for students or young professionals who are about to enter the car market. “Good options are always the Volkswagen Polo or Polo Vivo, the Toyota Aygo, Ford Fiesta, Nissan Micra, and Suzuki Swift, as well as the Suzuki Celerio,” said AutoTrader marketing director, Angelique Lynch. “These vehicles are all safe, economical and relatively affordable,” she said. “New launches you’ll want to know about include the new Renault Duster which comes out towards the end of the year, and the new Datsun GO.” Citing a reputable source, AutoTrader said that from November 2018, the Datsun GO will be gaining ABS and will have two airbags as standard. “Its frugal 1.2-litre engine sips 5.2 litres of fuel per 100 km/h (according to the manufacturer), and it carries an affordable price tag,” it said. The new Renault Duster is available in either 4×2 or 4×4 guise. The 1.5-litre diesel engine offers good fuel consumption of just 4.8 litres/100 km – according to Renault. “If you’re looking for a higher-priced new vehicle with all the green credentials, you’ll want to know about the Nissan Leaf,” Lynch said. The Nissan Leaf won Best Electric Car at the Whatcar? 2018 awards and it is the world’s best-selling electric car. “It’s a more expensive option, but it’s cheap to run, and kinder to the environment, of course,” Lynch said. The all-new Leaf is rumoured to have a bigger battery, a more powerful motor and an extended range. Nissan is still to announce the launch date in South Africa.
