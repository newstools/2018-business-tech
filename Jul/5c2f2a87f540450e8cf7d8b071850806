Siemens Gamesa South Africa has confirmed that it has won an order to supply wind turbines to two South African farms – benefiting from the nation’s plan to speed up its shift to clean power. The Spanish-German company will deliver 109 turbines with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts to Irish developer Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd, the company said on Wednesday (11 July). Siemens Gamesa will start delivery next year of its SWT-2.3-108 turbines to Mainstream’s 140-megawatt plant near Springbok, in the Northern Cape, and to a 110-megawatt plant in the Ceres region in the Western Cape. The projects won capacity in a government power auction, Siemens Gamesa said. Soon after being sworn in earlier this year, President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a raft of stalled renewable energy contracts. Read:Cash-strapped Eskom could lay off about 15,000 workers
