Power utility Eskom has warned that there is a high chance of load shedding today, due to ongoing protest and sabotage by its workers. The group said it was concerned about the ongoing industrial action by trade unions at various Eskom sites, over the issue of performance bonuses for the 2017/2018 financial year. “The current industrial action has negatively impacted plant operations at several power stations. This includes acts of intimidation, sabotage and obstruction of access controls for personnel. While the risk of load shedding remains high during this period, Eskom has activated all its emergency structures. Eskom is also urgently engaging union leaders to resolve this impasse,” it said. Eskom said that the SAPS has also been mobilised to assist in enabling safe access to power stations as these are National Key Points. “Customers are advised to plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place and are encouraged to check their load shedding schedules on the Eskom and their municipal website,” it said. The industrial action is as a result of Eskom and the trade unions not finding each other at the Central Bargaining Forum (CBF) last week Friday, where the unions planned to provide feedback on the wage offer Eskom tabled on 17 July 2018. On 27JuIy 2018 the parties met and deliberated on the wages and the additional demand for bonuses and jointly resolved to reconvene on Friday, 3 August 2018, for further talks. “Eskom would also like to remind all employees that the organisation has been designated as an essential service provider, and as such employees are prohibited from participating in any form of industrial action that will further hurt the country, its people and the economy.” The group said that it would keep the public updated on events.
