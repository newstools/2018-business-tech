Mercedes Benz officially launched its X-Class bakkie in South Africa in May. Despite the ‘Mercedes premium’ attached to the X-Class, the bakkie doesn’t quite hit six figures with the cheapest variant starting at R642,103 – rising to R791,315 for the most expensive option. However this could be set to change, with recent reports indicating that we could see a more expensive V6 X350d 4Matic X-Class flagship touching the R1 million price tag in South Africa in the first quarter of 2019. The X350d 4Matic will be powered by a 3.0 litre turbocharged V6 diesel motor, delivering 190 kW (258 hp) and a maximum torque of 550 newton metres, with peak torque coming between 1,400 rpm and 3,200 rpm. This top model sprints from zero to 100 km/h in 7.9 seconds, the German carmaker said in a statement in March. However as any car buyer knows, it is incredibly difficult to buy a car ‘as is’, with many motorists opting for features such as additional airbags, tracking systems and optional paint features. This is especially true for those looking to purchase a bakkie – with multiple added options for canopies, packages, and dividers. Below BusinessTech looked at the customisation options for the current R791,315 X-Class variant, and what it takes to build a R1 million bakkie. Paint and wheels New running total: R809,440  The X-Class is current available in a number of non-metallic variants including ‘Chisana White’, ‘Danakil red’, and ‘Granite green’. However if you are looking for a metallic paint option you will be expected to pay extra – with a set cost of R4,600 for your choice of ‘Axinit bronze’, ‘Bering white’, ‘Cavansite blue’, ‘Diamond silver’, ‘Kabara black’, and ‘Rock grey’ metallic paints. Similarly, the X-Class comes with 5.7 cm (18-inch) 6-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels at no extra chage. However you can choose to add 48.3 cm (19-inch) 6-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels for an additional R13,570. BusinessTech selected this additional wheel option and the Cavansite blue metallic paint for our vehicle of choice. Upholstery and trim New running total: R827,495  The X-Class offers a ‘Pixel look black’ colour as standard for its dashboard and surrounding trim. However you can opt to pay an additional R1,495 for an aluminium trim, or R3,105 for a ‘brown woodgrain look’ trim. Looking at the upholstery, the X-Class comes with Arico/Dinamica seats at no extra cost. However you can opt for black leather, or nut brown leather seats for R14,950. In keeping with our brown interior, BusinessTech selected the brown woodgrain look trim, and the nut brown leather seats. Optional accessories and equipment New running total: R997,409   Mercedes also allows buyers to select from a number of additional options and accessories from a wide list – including everything from covers, liners, canopies, parking assistance, telematics and towing extras.
