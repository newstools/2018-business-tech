Cell C on Monday announced the conclusion of an agreement that will see GloCell cede its Cell C contract customer base to South Africa’s third largest mobile service provider. GloCell was appointed as Service Agent for Cell C customers that were migrated from Altech Autopage in 2016. “We are excited to welcome GloCell contract customers to Cell C and believe this will result in a positive customer experience with Cell C’s extensive distribution and service network, now available to these customers,” said Jose Dos Santos, Cell C chief executive officer. “We would like to thank GloCell for the care they have taken with these customers as a service agent and we look forward to their support in integrating the customer base into Cell C,” said Dos Santos. The process to fully integrate the customers into Cell C’s systems is expected to be completed by mid-July. During the transition period, GloCell will continue to service this customer base. Cell C has put measures in place to ensure adequate support to GloCell. Customers should expect normal service to continue and will receive on-going communications on what they can expect during the migration period, Cell C said.
