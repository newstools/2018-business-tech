The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have set a deadline for mobile operator Vodacom to pay the claimed inventor of the ‘Please Call Me’ service. According to a report by Jacaranda, a number of EFF supporters have thrown their weight behind Nkosana Makate, and have indicated that they plan to target Vodacom’s stores if they don’t pay him 15% of the revenue it made from the service. A small group gathered at Vodacom’s headquarters in Midrand on Wednesday (18 July), where Vodacom managing executive for external relations, Themba Kinana, accepted their memorandum. In June it was reported that Makate had reached an agreement with Vodacom for a gag order, prohibiting the spread of any information regarding settlement negotiations between them. MyBroadband had previously reported that Vodacom made an offer of R10 million to Makate, which was described as a “pittance”, and far less than Makate’s legal fees for his decade-long battle with the operator. Makate’s disclosure of the R10 million offer was made in complaints he filed with the Independent Regulatory Board of Auditors and the Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission against Vodacom and its auditor PwC. As part of the order, Makate has reportedly undertaken not to disclose confidential issues as defined in the confidentiality agreement. He is also not allowed to discuss the content of the negotiations with any third parties – including the media. Read: Please Call Me inventor agrees to gag order
