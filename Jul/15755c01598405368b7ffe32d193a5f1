Former president Jacob Zuma is set to have a ‘dream team’ of legal representatives when he returns to court on corruption charges this week. This after he fired longtime attorney, Michael Hulley, at the beginning of July. According to a report by the Sunday Times, the four senior advocates and one junior counsel are estimated to cost anywhere between R160,000 and R290,000 a day. However, these costs are likely to rise  into the millions when Zuma goes to trial in November. In addition the Sunday Times reported that two of the advocates are also acting for Zuma’s son, Duduzane, and the Gupta family in state capture criminal cases, while neither has disclosed who is paying the bill. Presidency spokeswoman Khusela Diko said president Cyril Ramaphosa’s office had agreed to pay for only one senior advocate and two junior counsel, pending the outcome of a court challenge by the EFF and DA to block Zuma’s legal funding by the state. “The Presidency has approved a legal team of the same size as that which the former president previously had, being one senior and two junior counsel. We have made no further commitments,” Diko said. “The Presidency will honour only the commitment made to the payment of expenses related to a team of the size we’ve agreed to. We have no commitment beyond this and [are] thus not liable. Besides, we would not be in a position to legally justify such costs.” Read: Duduzane Zuma to hand himself in over Gupta charges
