Financial services company Old Mutual has announced the launch of its customer loyalty programme – Old Mutual Rewards. Consumers can earn rewards points for building financial knowledge and making sensible financial decisions, Old Mutual said in a statement on Monday (16 July). Point earning activities include completing financial assessments, using online calculators like the education savings or debt repayment calculators, and completing education modules on Moneyversity, Old Mutual’s online financial education hub. “Rewarding good financial behaviour is key to improving our nation’s savings culture and helping every South African – not only Old Mutual customers – to take charge of their own financial future,” said Jean Minnaar, general manager of product solutions at Old Mutual. “We believe that by encouraging certain behaviours, we will shift mindsets from consumerism to responsible planning and wealth creation. Among the behaviours we particularly hope to encourage are effective day-to-day money management, financial knowledge-seeking to support sound financial decision-making, gaining insight into your own financial needs, financial planning and goal setting. But most importantly, following through on financial decisions,” said Minnaar. He added that Old Mutual customers did not want to restrict the programme to customers only, and as such it will be open to all South Africans aged 18 and up.
