In a matter of weeks the City of Cape Town has pushed back its ‘day zero’ by over two months, with the date having now moved from 4 June to 9 July 2018. In a statement released on Tuesday (20 February), the City said that reduced consumption by Capetonian residents was the primary reason for the later date. “While we have not yet reached the target of 450 megalitres per day, we have together brought down our daily usage by 3 megalitres which is an encouraging step in the right direction. Over the past week, consumption has averaged 523 ML per day,” DA leader Mmusi Maimane said. “We must all continue to use under 50L per day so that Day Zero can be pushed even further back and it can be defeated altogether. It is this commitment and resilience that will enable us to together defeat Day Zero this year. “I would like to sincerely thank the private water transfer providers from Groenland, whose water transfer has significantly helped to push back Day Zero this week. I am enormously grateful for their commitment to the people of the Western Cape. They have joined many businesses, as well the agricultural sector, in making a huge effort to cut consumption and Defeat Day Zero.” The City said it would continue the aggressive roll-out of pressure management initiatives, and enforcement blitzes to ensure that its target measures are met.
