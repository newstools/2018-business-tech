Google has launched its ‘Android Enterprise Recommended’ programme, with the aim of making it simple for businesses to confidently select Android devices that meet elevated enterprise requirements validated by Google. “Android Enterprise Recommended, a Google-led program raises the bar of excellence for enterprise devices and services,” Google explained in a statement on the programme’s website. “The program establishes best practices and common requirements, backed by rigorous testing so you can confidently deploy Android in your enterprise,” it said. According to Google, the programme will ensure devices are up to date with regular security patches delivered within 90 days, and are also guaranteed to get at least one additional major OS update. Other considerations made by Google in selecting the devices include minimum hardware specifications, bulk enrollment and user experience. The list of phones also covers a wide range of manufacturers and budgets, meaning there is a suitable option for every type of business. Below are the 21 phones currently on its ‘recommended’ list. Not all devices are available in South Africa. Blackberry KEYone
