The EFF plans to introduce a motion on land expropriation without compensation to Parliament as early as Tuesday (27 February) . According to a report by Die Burger, the motion will help establish a multi-party committee whose sole function will be to discuss amending section 25 of the Constitution to allow for the appropriation changes. The EFF had previously pledged its 6% parliamentary vote to ensure that the ANC would have two-thirds majority – a requirement when amending the South African Constitution. EFF spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, confirmed that the motion was set to be tabled next week but would not provide further information as to its contents. In his state of the nation address (Sona) delivered last week, newly-elected president Cyril Ramaphosa pledged to speed up the pace of land redistribution, but said that numerous discussions were required so as not to endanger food security or the economy. In his reply to the Sona address on Tuesday, Ramaphosa said that he would not allow for ‘smash and grab” interventions when it comes to addressing the land question. “We must not see the redistribution of land as a threat. We should see it as an opportunity to address the injustices of the past,” Ramaphosa said. Read: Who could be out in Ramaphosa’s first cabinet reshuffle: report
