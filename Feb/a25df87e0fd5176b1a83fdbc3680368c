Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete believes that the issue of president Jacob Zuma’s resignation is set to be behind South Africa “quite soon”, and that an announcement should be made early in the coming week. Speaking to Sky News on Thursday, Mbete said that she understood South Africa was anxious regarding the outcome. “It might be that right now (because of our anxiety) we might be very feeling very impatient – but we also have to be,” she said. “But I think early in this coming week it will be clearer following further consultations over the weekend. “So I am saying hopefully early in the week we will actually be able to indicate that we are moving on, give you a date, start the plans, and put a date in place for the state of the nation address before the end of the week.” On Tuesday, Mbete announced that parliament would postpone the state of the nation address (originally scheduled for Thursday, 8 February) after several requests were made by political parties to have the date pushed back until there was political stability. “We are listening to political stakeholders and members of the public in making this decision,” Mbete said on the postponement. “We are in continuing discussions with the president of the ANC as he is the leader of government business in parliament. We are also in contact with all political parties.” Read: Ramaphosa has a limited window to act against Zuma: analyst
