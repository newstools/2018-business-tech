Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: Speculation over Zuma’s fate will linger a while longer, as the NEC meeting set up to discuss the matter has now been delayed to February 17th. Media reports, citing party insiders, say that Zuma has agreed to resign but only if certain conditions are met. The delay in the NEC meeting is to give Zuma and new party president Cyril Ramaphosa time to talk things out. Parliament says that it is doing everything it can to keep the 2018 Budget Speech on track, despite the delay of the State of the Nation Address and its subsequent debates. Any delay in the budget speech will have an impact on governance and also the public that need services. The speech is tabled for 21 February. South African business confidence is at its highest point in over two and a half years, according to the Sacci BCI. The rise has been driven by positive sentiment towards the South African economy since the start of the year, feeding off the effect of changes to the ANC’s leadership. Water wasters in Cape Town can expect much higher water bills this month, as the city’s new punitive water tariffs are now in effect. The fines will hit anyone who uses more than the allotted 6,000 litres a month (50 litres per person, per day), starting at R180, and running up to over R20,000 for extreme water abusers. South Africa’s rand firmed against the dollar on Tuesday as the market positioned for the possible removal from office of President Jacob Zuma, while share prices hit a four-month low as the global stocks rout intensified. On Wednesday the rand was trading at R11.95 to the dollar, R16.69 to the pound and R14.81 to the euro.
