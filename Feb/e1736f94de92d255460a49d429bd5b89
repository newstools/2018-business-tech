The ANC’s parliamentary caucus has agreed to pass a motion of no confidence in president Jacob Zuma as early as tomorrow – whether he responds to the party’s recall or not. The party’s caucus met in a briefing arranged by ANC treasurer general, Paul Mashatile, to discuss the party’s announcement that it would recall president Jacob Zuma. Counter to secretary general, Ace Magashule’s statement that there was no set deadline for the president to respond and accede to the recall, Mashatile said that the deadline is today (Wednesday, 14 February), and that the ANC’s parliamentary caucus must get ready to take action if he fails to do so. Mashatile said that the ANC would push for the tabling of a motion of no confidence in Zuma, to be debated in parliament as early as Thursday. He said the party does not want to leave the people of South Africa waiting, and whether president Zuma responds today or not, the party must proceed with the parliamentary processes. Speaking on the outcomes of the caucus meeting, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said that the ANC would have preferred to have its own motion, but its rules allow for an amendment to be made to the EFF’s motion of no confidence which is already tabled. Mthembu said would this allow the ANC to then vote with the EFF to give Zuma the boot, after which they would like to elect ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa as the country’s new president.
