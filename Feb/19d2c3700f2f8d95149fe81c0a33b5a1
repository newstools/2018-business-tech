The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development has published a proposed amendment to the Constitution, seeking to change a number of provincial borders across the Eastern Cape, KwaZuluNatal, the North West and the Northern Cape. The proposed amendments, which are open for public comment until Wednesday, 28 February 2018, will require a supporting vote of at least two thirds of the members of the National Assembly and at least six provinces in terms of the National Council of Provinces. The issue of changing borders has long been a contentious one, with the notable 2006 Constitutional Court judgement of Matatiele finding that proper and extensive consultation is of the utmost importance when redetermining boundaries. The case was brought to court by the Matatiele municipality which argued that it was not consulted on changes which saw it fall under the Eastern Cape instead of KwaZuluNatal, and that there was a clear difference in service delivery to the area after the switch. It also raised concerns over the fact that it held longstanding historical connections to the province. According to the attached explanation, the primary reason for these changes emanates from the communities of the areas in question who wish to be relocated to neighbouring provinces. “Service delivery, places of doing their business and transportation are some of the most significant reasons requested relocations,” the proposed amendment states.
