Ignite, the service provider from Internet Solutions focused on South African SMEs, has been announced as an official reseller of Cell C LTE services in South Africa. This comes off the back of the recent announcement which saw Internet Solutions partnering with Cell C to expand the operator’s LTE services. Ignite clients will have access to Cell C’s LTE offering at the following monthly prices: 50GB bundle – R349.00
100GB bundle – R530.00
200GB bundle – R845.00 These bundles are available as SIM-only options or can be purchased with a free Huawei B315 router, Ignite said. RICA-compliant subscribers can migrate between packages, upgrade or downgrade from the beginning of a new month. If the monthly data cap is reached, the subscriber will be redirected to the Ignite web page payment gateway where they can top up their account with a data bundle ranging from 1GB to 20GB (valid for 30 days from the date of purchase), the company said. It noted that customers can expect average download speeds of up to 69Mbps dependent on their location and the coverage for that area.
