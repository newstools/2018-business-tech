The new South Africa-bound Ford Raptor Ranger was unveiled at a press event in Thailand on Wednesday. “Meet the latest edition to the Ford Performance line-up, and the most epic Ranger we’ve engineered. The first-ever Ford Ranger Raptor,” said Ford South Africa in a social media post. “The Ford Performance team is excited to extend the Raptor name from our flagship off-road performance F-150 to Ranger. Just like the F-150 Raptor, the Ranger Raptor builds upon the core capability of the range of vehicles it comes from and carries the unmistakable Ford Performance DNA appearance,” Ford said. Under the bonnet is a 2.0-litre bi-turbo diesel engine making 157kW of power and 500Nm of torque. Measuring 1.87 metres tall (up 52mm), 2.18 metres wide (331mm wider) and 5.39 metres long (30mm longer), the Raptor raises its ground clearance to 283mm, 46mm higher than regular Rangers. Colours include include lightning blue, race red, shadow black, frozen white, and hero colour, conquer grey. It is unclear when the Raptor will launch in South Africa, or what its pricing will be, however it is likely to begin sales only in 2019.
