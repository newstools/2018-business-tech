BankservAfrica’s latest take-home pay and private pensions indices show that 2018 is off to a good start, with growth experienced in both nominal and real terms. The BankservAfrica Take-home Pay Index shows average formal sector pay was R14,675 in January 2018, 5.8% higher than January 2017 before inflationary adjustment. This increase was lower than December’s growth of 7.3%. However, when adjusted in line with inflation, take-home pay increased by 1.2% on a year-on-year basis, and represents the slowest increase in five months. “This positive real increase for money banked by employees’ points to a gradual increase in living standards for most formally employed people,” said Mike Schüssler, chief economist at Economists dot coza. The typical formal employee experienced a real increase of 2.2% – nearly double that of the average take-home pay increase. The share of employees who receive up to R4,000 per month declined to 13.7% in January 2017 compared to 15.2% in January 2018. This is a 7.8% decline in the number of employees receiving less than R4,000 per month over the last year. Those earning monthly salaries between R12,000 and R1,000 now stand at 474,000 people, which is more than the 436,900 who earn below R4,000. While the number of employees taking home between R12,000 and R16,000 only grew by 1.2% , this number is still higher than the number of earners in the low-income category. A quick review of the salary index shows that the real increase average was 1% more than in 2016, the group said. Real take-home pay declined in the first two months of the year and then gradually increased. In the last three months of 2017, take-home pay increased by 2.8% on average after inflation.
