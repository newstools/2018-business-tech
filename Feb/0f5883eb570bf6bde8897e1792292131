FlySafair says it has become the first local low-cost carrier to offer cashless transactions on all of its flights. The airline has officially launched AviaPay, a new mobile point of sale (POS) system, enabling passengers to use their credit and debit cards to purchase refreshments inflight. The solution, which is the result of a partnership between BlueMarket Retail Solutions, and payment service providers, PayGate and PosMarket, was specifically designed to address the needs of the aviation industry. Another major benefit of the technology is that FlySafair now provides travellers with receipts, regardless of the payment method used. This makes it far simpler for business travellers to manage their expense claims. Dealing with the administration relating to these claims also becomes easier for the travel management teams which process them, the airline said. “There are already discussions around added functionality, and we look forward to building on a relationship that has had a fantastic start. Look out for new innovations to be launched in the near future with FlySafair,” said Theron Uys, business development director at BlueMarket. Rival operator Kulula.com meanwhile, said it plans to make in-flight cashless payments a reality on its planes. The company recently told MyBroadband it is currently testing a cashless system on its flights, which will remove the need for passengers to pay for items using physical cash.
