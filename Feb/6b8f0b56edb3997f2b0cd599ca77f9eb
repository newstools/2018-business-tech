The British government has issued a travel warning to its citizens in South Africa, following potential terror activities in the country. In a post published on the UK government’s official travel advice page, it warned that UK citizens in particular were targets and at risk of kidnapping for financial gain. The statement reads: The advisory follows reports that police and intelligence agencies have linked the disappearance of a Cape Town couple to a cell with ties to the global terror group ISIS. The missing couple, whose names have been withheld by authorities, are understood to have been kidnapped while on holiday in KwaZulu-Natal, reports TimesLive. Following their disappearance, a man and woman who had been held under surveillance by counter-terrorism agents were arrested in a covert swoop in Vryheid in northern KwaZulu-Natal.
