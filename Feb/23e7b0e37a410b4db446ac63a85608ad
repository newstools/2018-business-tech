McCormick property development has confirmed that it is currently in the process of developing a major new shopping centre in Tembisa on Gauteng’s East Rand. Speaking to BusinessTech, Jason McCormick, MD of McCormick property development, said that the mall will be completed after an 18 month build-programme in the first quarter of 2020 – although the group is pushing to move this forward to early 2019. The gross leasable area of the mall is planned at 43,000sqm with Shoprite and Superspar confirmed as the supermarket anchors, while discussions with Game, Dischem and Edgars as additional tenants are at an advanced stage, he said. “The mall will have in excess of 100 stores (although the final number is not yet confirmed) and will include the full gamut of national fashion retailers, Truworths, Foschini, Mr Price and Pepkor groups, full service banks, wholesale butchery and liquor stores, a vibrant food court including kids play areas, gaming arcades, action sports fields as well as a large day clinic and health facilities.” “It is too premature to commit to the exact tenant mix and this is anticipated to be finalised over the next 2-3 months,” McCormick said. The current cost of development is approximately R750 million which will allows for world-class finishes throughout the mall, with inspiration taken from malls around the world – including elements from malls in Morocco, Turkey and Dubai. “We are looking at making this a beacon of environmental sustainability and have a number of features that we are looking to pioneer in this regard, in order to challenge the rest of the development industry to take ownership of the challenges facing the country in terms of not only energy, but water efficiency, harvesting and reuse, recycling and improvement water quality in the stream and of biodiversity in the green-belt adjacent the mall,” McCormick said. Below are some of the initial perspectives of the new mall, although some features are likely to change – including some entrance features and aesthetic elements, said McCormick.
