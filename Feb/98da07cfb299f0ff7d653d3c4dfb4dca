Mustek Limited, one of the country’s largest assemblers and distributors of Information Communication Technology and complimentary solutions, has added Acronis backup software solutions to its portfolio to complement its existing hardware offering. “We are constantly looking to expand our portfolio in order to provide greater value to our stakeholders. Acronis fills a crucial gap on the software side of our back-up offering, enabling us to provide a far more complete portfolio to the benefit of our customers,” says Juan Paul Gough, solutions architect at Mustek. Acronis has a particularly good name and reputation when it comes to backup solutions. Not only is it fast and easy-to-use, but it is also able to be deployed on premises, in the cloud or on mobile devices. Also worth noting is that with Acronis Instant Restore, recovery time objectives (RTOs) are reduced to seconds. The solution is also one of the most innovative and reliable on the market, comprised of Acronis Active Protection from ransomware, enhanced backup validation, and blockchain-based authentication of backups with Acronis Notary. “With the ever-increasing threat of cyber-attacks with estimated losses of $5 000 000 000 in 2017 on ransomware alone, it’s become more important than ever for businesses and consumers alike to have peace of mind that they have a reliable backup solution in place. Preventative measures like anti-virus alone are not enough and we all need to be prepared should the unthinkable happen if we find ourselves in the midst of a system exploit. Acronis offers that peace of mind,” comments Gough. This article was published in partnership with Mustek.
