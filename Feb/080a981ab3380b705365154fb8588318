Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa is coming under mounting pressure to resolve the impasse in getting president Jacob Zuma to step down. Unions and members of the ANC and opposition parties want the matter resolved in the next few days. Meanwhile, Ramaphosa has said that immunity for Zuma is not on the cards as part of the negotiations. The Public Servants Association is taking finance minister Malusi Gigaba to task over the Public Investment Corp.’s operations, which it says it putting close to R2 trillion worth of the public’s money at risk of looting. The group is taking exception to the PIC’s move to bail out Eskom for R5 billion, and its recent losses with the Steinhoff crash. Social grants group Sassa wants to extend an invalid contract with CPS for social grants payments in the country, from 1 April 2018 for another 6 months. Sassa justified the extension in statement saying that it could not find an alternative service provider. The CPS contract was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court in 2014. More water experts are warning that the Cape Town crisis is just the start of a national problem, where demand on water outstrips supply every year. Several experts have warned that beyond Cape Town and the Eastern Cape where the drought has hit hardest, even rain-heavy areas like Gauteng are at risk of future crises if something isn’t done. South Africa’s rand edged firmer on Thursday but remained above the crucial R12.00 mark against the dollar as the continuing stalemate over President Jacob Zuma’s future capped demand. On Friday the rand was trading at R12.13 to the dollar, R16.90 to the pound and R14.86 to the euro.
