The Limpopo Provincial Government, through Limpopo Connexion SOC, has appointed Altron’s Altech Radio Holdings (ARH) to build a secure, open access broadband network across the province, in line with the National Broadband Policy: SA Connect. The Phase One R585 million project will see ICT connectivity provided to government departments, municipalities, businesses and households across the province over a three-year period. Additional services to be provided include a Network Operation, Control Centre and Data Centre. ARH’s appointment follows similar broadband roll-outs in Gauteng, which saw the successful implementation of the Gauteng Broadband Network incorporating 1600km of high-speed fibre optics. This network connected in excess of 400 buildings, 45 community service centres (Thusong Centres), 20 identified priority townships, nine Economic Development Zones, six urban renewal nodes and several hundred schools under a build and transfer deal. In addition, ARH is currently in a joint partnership to design, deploy, maintain, and operate a citywide backbone broadband network for the City of Tshwane. “It is a priority of government’s National Development Plan to connect all South Africans to broadband infrastructure. Broadband is an economic enabler, and the South African government has identified the need to invest in information communication technologies, including broadband infrastructure, to support economic growth, development and social cohesion,” said Brett Nash, MD of ARH. “As a result of this and other public broadband networks, public services, health and educational information products will become accessible to all.” Read: Altron sells shares in Powertech for R250 million
