UK finance magazine Euromoney has published its annual Private Banking and Wealth Managment Survey for 2018, ranking the best finance groups and asset managers for wealthy people across the world. The rankings are based on a survey undertaken by wealth managers and private banking groups themselves on which other companies they believe are their biggest competitors – therefore it serves as a peer review. Private banking is defined as financial services targeted at individuals who have over $1 million in investable assets, Euromoney said. Globally, USB Global Wealth Management retained the top spot on the ranking, with the Swiss bank sweeping up top marks across almost all categories covered by the survey. The bank was followed by JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, which also retained their second and third spots, respectively. In South Africa, Investec ranked as the top private banking group in the country – and also ranked at the top of the list for the super affluent ($1 million to $5 million) high net worth individuals ($5 million to $30 million) and ultra-high net worth individuals (more than $30 million). Investec also topped the rankings for the best private bank to deliver research and asset allocation advice, as well as being ranked as the best bank for international clients. RMB Private Bank ranked as the second-best private bank in the South Africa, overall, followed by Nedbank Private Wealth, Absa, and Standard Bank.
