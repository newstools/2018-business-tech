In line with its famous “Rich list”, Forbes has released a new report on the twenty richest people based on their estimated holdings in cryptocurrency. Forbes based its statistics on estimated holdings of cryptocurrencies, post-tax profits from trading crypto-assets and stakes in crypto-related businesses, and locked in the estimates using prices on 19 January 2018. While it acknowledged that it likely missed some people (due to the secretive nature of Bitcoin), the report said that this was also the case for its traditional rich list, and that it was vitally important to produce the list and “make the world a better place by shining a light on the invisible rich”. According to the data you would need a minimum of $350 million minimum to make the list of cryptocurrency’s wealthiest people. You are also more likely to be younger than the rest of the world’s wealthy, with Forbes finding that the average age of the cryptocurrency’s richest people was just 42 (compared to 67 on the Forbes 400 list).
