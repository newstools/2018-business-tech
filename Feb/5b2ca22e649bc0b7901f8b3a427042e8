Volkswagen has announced that it will soon be offering a convertible cabriolet based on its popular T-Roc SUV. The company said that the new model will be produced from the first half of 2020, and confirmed that it would be investing more than €80 million (R1.14 billion) in its Osnabrück plant for this purpose. “Volkswagen is evolving into an SUV brand. The T-Roc is already setting new standards in the compact SUV segment,” said Dr Herbert Diess, CEO of the Volkswagen brand. “With the cabriolet based on the T-Roc, we will be adding a highly emotional model to the range. “I am especially pleased to note that we can count on the Osnabrück team’s decades of experience with convertibles. The Osnabrück plant now has bright prospects for the future,” he said. SUVs are currently making a key contribution to the growth of the Volkswagen Group’s core brand. Notably, with 720,000 Tiguan vehicles delivered, the car is among the 10 best-selling models in the world and among the top three SUVs. By 2020, the brand intends to expand its SUV range throughout the world to 20 models, and by then it believes that about 40% of the vehicles sold by Volkswagen will be SUVs. “With the new cabriolet based on the T-Roc, Volkswagen will further reinforce its presence in the compact SUV segment, one of the fastest-growing segments in global automobile markets,” it said.
