The City of Cape Town’s water crisis ‘day zero’ – the day the taps run dry leaving residents to start queuing for water – has been pushed back by another month, to 4 June 2018 which falls within the region’s rainy season. This marks the second push back in as many weeks, after the agricultural sector agreed to cut back its water use, which pushed day zero from 16 April to 11 May. The most recent jump has again been credited to the continued decline in agricultural usage, while Capetonians have also reduced their overall water consumption. Capetonians have managed to reduce their collective water usage to 526 million litres per day. The City is targeting 450 million litres (50 litres per person per day), which is the level at which the City may be able to avoid day zero entirely. The latest data from the City of Cape Town indicates that dam storage level is at 24.9% – a weekly decrease of -0.6%. National government has declared the drought affecting the southern and western areas of South Africa a national disaster. Read: Cape Town’s Day Zero has been pushed out by a month
