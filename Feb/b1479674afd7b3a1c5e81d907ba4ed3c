A stunning and unique home – described as “one of the most remarkable houses in the world” – is set to go on auction in Cape Town on 28 March 2018. Located in the exclusive Constantia Nek area of Hout Bay, “this iconic home has been inspired by the very essence of (and the mystery of) Africa”, said Rawson Auctions. “Beautifully crafted from a fusion of natural stone, hand-selected woods, glass and tranquil streams, this totally unique property has evolved from decades of careful and creative construction,” it said. The home – Blackwood Manor – is also described as a living work of art and therefore comes with a reserve price of R65 million, along with  a 10% commission plus VAT over and above bid amount.
