Taste Holdings has announced that its next Starbucks store will be opening in Sandton City in May 2018. The 305 square metre store will feature the Starbucks core menu as well as the group’s fresh food selection, a range of Teavana teas and free high-speed Wi-Fi. Having secured the rights to Starbucks outlets in South Africa in July 2015, Taste now has nine stores in the country, following the opening of two stores in Durban near the end of 2017. Taste had previously stated plans to launch an outlet in Cape Town by the end of the year, but that has not materialised. However, the group did confirm late last year that a launch in the mother city was still on the cards. The company said it has taken a conservative approach to openings amid the need to raise money. Reporting on its latest financial year, Taste said that while the individual Starbucks stores are profitable, “the challenge now is to grow those stores and to keep on opening in profitable locations to the point that there are enough to cover the overheads”. The company was targeting 8 to 10 new branches by the end of its next financial year. It costs Taste about R5 million rand to R6 million to open a store.
