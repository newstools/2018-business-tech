For a second consecutive month, motorists are experiencing further relief at the pumps following a decrease in the price of all grades of petrol and diesel this past week. The department of energy announced that motorists would pay 30 cents less per litre for both grades of petrol, 17 cents less for diesel, while the price of illuminating paraffin dropped by 19 cents, thanks to a stronger rand and weaker oil prices. Savings Absa provided a break down of how these fuel price changes would reflect in savings, depending on the type of car you own. Given the time of year and based on current consumer concerns, the bank said that these extra savings would best be put to use towards stationary budgets, extra school shirts, or adding it to your savings account. BusinessTech also looked at how much you would be saving if you drive one of the 10 bestselling cars in South Africa (based on Naamsa’s January 2018 data), or similar models. Where possible BusinessTech selected the cheapest diesel and petrol models of each car. * indicates no diesel equivalent Read: Western Cape to discuss ‘hair raising’ driving demerit system
