The Gauteng Provincial Government has published it latest Road Traffic Regulations, detailing the province’s latest vehicle licence fees, for public comment. The regulations form part of the annual provincial review, with the Gauteng MEC recommending a fee increase of 7.7% (i.e. CPI + 2) for the 2018/19 financial year. This increase means that Gauteng motorists can expect to pay R204 for a motorcycle licence, and anywhere between R204 (0-250kg) to R24,528 (12,001kg+) to renew their annual car licence. These changes will come into effect as of 1 April 2018, and interested parties are invited to make comments on the regulations on or before 8 March 2018. The full list of proposed changes, including the fees for specific vehicle weight-classes can be found here.
