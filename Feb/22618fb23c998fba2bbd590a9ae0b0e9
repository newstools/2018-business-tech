The salary information is based on Michael Page’s extensive recruitment database, which covers more than 1,536 job roles, and over 100,000 candidates. According to the recruiter, South Africa’s professional labour market has been, and continues to be, an unpredictable environment, with lingering political uncertainty, and companies expecting a mixed-bag of results. “Despite the ongoing mix of good and bad news that we have experienced over the past 3 years, Michael Page has recorded its 3 strongest results in this time, and like most South Africans, we like to approach the future with a positive and optimistic mindset,” the group said. “The majority of our clients now believe that 2018 will be a continuation of the current market, with some sectors expecting solid growth while others are forecasting at trading conditions.” However, demand for skilled professionals in the workplace remains high, particularly in the financial services sector, in all roles from bankers and accountants to IT and support. The IT sector, meanwhile, is seeing stable demand, the group said. “There is also the continued investment from multinational rms across a variety of industry sectors who are investing or setting up in South Africa,” it said. As per its salary survey for 2018, here are the average salaries professionals can expect to earn in 2018. The data covers professionals in the finance, IT, engineering, human resources, marketing, procurement, supply chain and legal sectors. The averages represent annual salaries, in thousands of rands (R’000). Sectors marked with a * show the salary ranges for large companies.
