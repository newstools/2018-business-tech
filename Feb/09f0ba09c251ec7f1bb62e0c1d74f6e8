The Gautrain has launched a new website and mobile app, which will give commuters access to new features like profile management and trip planning. The new platforms were launched by Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport, Ismail Vadi, on Thursday, at the Technology Innovation Conference 2018 held at the Gallagher Conference Centre. The new website and mobile application are user-friendly interfaces on which users can register and receive profiled and relevant travel information online at their own convenience. “This is one of the many System enhancements that have been implemented on the Gautrain since the start of operations to ensure that the Gautrain is quick, convenient and efficient”, said Vadi. Passengers can now manage their Gautrain cards, trip planning and refund claims online. They will also be able to register their cards, reload funds, buy Gautrain travel products passes, purchase bulk cards, view their card transaction history, check their card expiry dates and plan their real-time trips. Although passengers will still be able to buy their cards at any Gautrain Station, the new website and mobile application will allow passengers to create a profile where they will be able to manage their ticketing online by linking many cards to their online profile, check expiry dates and even block cards online. Another feature on the new Gautrain website and mobile application is the trip planning tool which assists passengers to plan their route. Passengers are able to locate their nearest Gautrain Station from their current location or type in the address they would like to use, to start planning their trip provided their GPS location services is switched on. They would be able to locate the nearest bus, thereafter be able to see real-time train schedules of their origin and destination stations within their trip as well as the total cost of the trip.
