Listed ICT and technology solutions provider Jasco is set to purchase 51% of Ramm Technologies for R30.6 million Established in 1998, Ramm and initially specialised in the development of asset tracking systems based on GSM networks and geographic information systems platforms. More recently, Ramm has upgraded its commercial model for Internet of Things services, which allows for data analytics from several thousand devices deployed at customer premises. Ramm operates its own National Operations Centre, from where it monitors its customers’ assets and productivity. This service offering has resulted in Ramm’s revenue consisting of more than 80% annuity revenue. Its operations cover Gauteng and the Western Cape with offices in both provinces. Its customer base is predominantly the major municipalities, which it has serviced for more than 10 years. Ramm assists these municipal customers by ensuring that all services that are rendered are being billed correctly. The group has reported double-digit revenue growth since 2015, with consistent operating margins above 15%, it said. “The Ramm acquisition will ensure an entry for Jasco into the asset tracking market through IOT, as well as further growth into the public sector. The acquisition creates the opportunity to cross-sell the Jasco product and service offering to Ramm customers and Ramm’s technology solutions to Jasco’s blue-chip corporate customer base,” Jasco said by way of rationale for the acquisition.
