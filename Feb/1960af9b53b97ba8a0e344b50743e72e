The department of energy has announced the petrol and diesel price changes taking effect this week. From Wednesday (7 February) motorists can expect to pay 30 cents less per litre for both grades of petrol, and 17 cents less per litre on the price of diesel. The price of illuminating paraffin will be dropping by 19 cents per litre. According to the department, the main contributor to the petrol price drop was the stronger rand, which countered the rising global cost of brent crude oil. “The rand appreciated, on average, against the US dollar (from R13.23 to R12.20 per USD) during the period under review. This led to a lower contribution to the basic fuel price on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 52.85cpl, 54.66cpl and 54.88cpl respectively,” the department said. The average brent crude oil price, meanwhile, increased from $64.08 to $69.11 during the same period. The fuel price changes for different zones in South Africa will only be published on Tuesday, the department said. The changes are as follows: Petrol 93: 30 cents per litre decrease
Petrol 95: 30 cents per litre decrease
Diesel 0.05%: 17 cents per litre decrease
Diesel 0.005%: 17 cents per litre decrease
