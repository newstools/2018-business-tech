Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: President Cyril Ramaphosa has sidelined Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and ended an impasse between government and the mining sector over the controversial mining charter. In a statement by Ramaphosa at the weekend, he said that the parties had agreed to end court processes, and head back to the negotiation table. The Hawks has distanced itself from private parties offering rewards of over R1.5 million for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the Gupta brothers and former president Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane. The investigative unit said the rewards will cause people to chase after the money and could put them in harm’s way. Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane faces legal bills of almost R1 million in her failed court battle against Absa and the SARB. A Friday ruling set aside Mkhwebane’s report on alleged apartheid-era looting by the then Bankoprp-group. In the ruling, the judge put a punitive cost order against the public protector. Lindiwe Sisulu, Baleka Mbete and Naledi Pandor are among some of the names being thrown around to take over the role of deputy president until the 2019 elections – with Sisulu a favourite for the position, the Mail & Guardian reports. President Cyril Ramaphosa met with Sisulu, the current Human Settlements Minister this past weekend, further fuelling speculation. South Africa’s rand surrendered some gains on Friday but remained near its three-year best ahead of Cyril Ramaphosa’s maiden state of the nation address after he was sworn in as the country’s president. On Monday the rand was at R11.66 to the dollar, R16.35 to the pound and R14.47 to the euro.
