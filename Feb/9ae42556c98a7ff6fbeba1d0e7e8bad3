Development on a R1.5 billion skyscraper in Cape Town, dubbed ‘The Modern’, is expected to begin in March 2018, with a 36 month development period. Upon completion it will form part of four buildings reshaping the citiy’s skyline, with several additional developments underway. According to developers, Ingenuity Property, the building will be located on the corner of Bree, Loop and Hans Strijdom Avenue, and will combine the old with a new ‘post-modern’ style. The building will feature a high-rise glass structure on top of a podium base, with a ‘twist’ to the facade, adding shape. It will offer 24 luxury apartments, a 230 room 5-star hotel, and 814 square metres of retail space. The development will also offer over 10,000 square metres of premium office space.

The Modern is one of four planned ‘tower’ developments in Cape Town, which includes the Zero2One, The Vogue, and 16 on Bree, which still needs to be finalised – all competing to be the new tallest building in the Mother City. Beyond the four towers, Cape Town will also see more skyscrapers being developed along the city’s Foreshore area. These developments can be seen below.
