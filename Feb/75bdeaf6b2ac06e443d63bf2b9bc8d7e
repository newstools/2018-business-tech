Sun City founder and hotel magnate Sol Kerzner has unveiled his latest project with his daughter, Andrea: a stunning luxury security estate in Leeukoppie, Cape Town. Kerzner, 81, is one of South Africa’s most successful businesspeople, known for building luxury hotels and resorts around the world. These include the likes Sun City, the Lost City, Sandton Sun, the Beverley Hills Hotel, and the Elangeni. Global hotels include Atlantis Dubai, the One & Only Mexico, the One & Only Australia, the One & Only Mauritius and the One & Only Bahamas. Since leaving the hotel business, Kerzner revealed in a 2017 interview that he was looking to get into the residential property space, leveraging the 10 hectares of land he owned between Hout Bay and Llandudno. Known for luxury hospitality, the new Kerzner-branded estate in Leeukoppie will offer unique, resort-style services such as horse riding lessons, catering services, housekeeping options and airport transfers. The estate will feature 48 sites for luxury homes, built with the design brief to be as economic and environmentally friendly as possible. According to the development’s site, the estate has been designed to be ‘eco-aware’, with measures taken to maintain and enhance the natural beauty in the surrounds. “Where alien vegetation has been removed, indigenous fynbos has been replanted,” it said.  The first phase of luxury homes (covering sites 12 through to 19) have also been unveiled with some artists impressions of how they will look and fit into the surrounding landscape. The houses are being designed by an array of architects, with prices ranging from R20.5 million for a 374 sqm house on a 1060sqm property, to R30.5 million for a 738sqm home on a 1487sqm property. Some concept images from the designers can be seen below. Exteriors  Interiors  Read: A look at the insane R18 billion Kerzner-branded hotel development in Dubai
