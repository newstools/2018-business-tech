A2X Markets (A2X), a new, independent stock exchange, has partnered with vendor neutral data centre, Teraco, to bring its trading platform closer to clients. In a growing trend seeing financial institutions changing to multiple-provider platforms, A2X says it’s collaboration with Teraco will enable A2X’s clients to connect and get up and running in a quick and cost-effective way. “Internationally, stock exchange competition leads to improved responsiveness and innovation while providing more liquidity, ultimately making the cost of execution lower. It is an exciting business venture and Teraco is delighted that A2X has chosen its extensive ecosystem to grow and develop the new exchange,” said Lex van Wyk, CEO at Teraco. A2X competes directly with the JSE providing an alternative platform for companies to secondary list and trade shares. “We reviewed the local data centre market extensively and found Teraco to be the only true, network agnostic provider, which was critical to not only our decision, but more importantly, our value proposition. “By hosting A2X’s primary data centre at Teraco, we are able to offer our clients an extensive list of connectivity options including the low latency option of colocating their systems with A2X,” said Neal Lawrence, CTO at A2X. He said that Teraco is able to provide A2X and its clients with access to several leading companies via local Points of Presence (PoPs), cross connects or peering through Africa’s largest Internet Exchange (IXP), NAPAfrica. “Teraco has access to the largest carrier ecosystem as well as a 72-hour turnaround for any client wanting to connect within the ecosystem,” Lawrence said.
