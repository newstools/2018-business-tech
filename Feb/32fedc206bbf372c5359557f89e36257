Construction commenced on the new Southern Africa offices of global professional services company, Accenture. Situated in the heart of Waterfall’s Corporate Campus, the new 3875m² facility will see Accenture South Africa relocate from its current offices in Woodmead to Waterfall City’s precinct in December 2018, as part of its Africa expansion strategy. Attacq, the commercial developers of Waterfall, partnered with accomplished property developers, Zenprop, to bring the innovative new Accenture office to Waterfall. “We would like to extend a warm welcome to Accenture; we are thrilled they have decided to make their new home with us at Waterfall City. Waterfall is increasingly becoming the hub of consulting and professional firms in Gauteng. As we continue to grow and develop the Waterfall precinct, it is heartening to see that such top calibre companies share and endorse our vision,” said Melt Hamman, interim CEO, Attacq. Waterfall City is South Africa’s largest urban concept development, centrally located in relation to Pretoria and Johannesburg, with close proximity to major highways, transport nodes, and the Gautrain Station. The precinct is already home to the Mall of Africa, the Cell C campus, Deloitte’s new R1 billion campus, a Dimension Data warehouse, and PwC Tower Headquarters.
