Isuzu Motors South Africa says it will bring its latest SUV model to South Africa – the MU-X. The MU-X, which is already available in Australia and parts of Eastern Asia, will boast a 3.0 litre turbo diesel engine that produces 430Nm of torque, terrain command 4×4 system supported by a 5-link rear suspension, and a luxury seven-seat interior. The model will be available in 2×4 and 4×4 configurations, with further pricing details and specifications expected closer to when the vehicle launches in the second-half of 2018. In addition to being Isuzu’s first competitor in the SUV for over a decade, the MU-X also forms part of the company’s future commitment to the country. Isuzu Motors announced the official launch of its business operations in South Africa on Friday (16 February), following an announcement last year that it would purchase the light commercial vehicle operations in Port Elizabeth and also the balance of shareholding in its Isuzu Trucks South Africa operations. Speaking at the event which was held at manufacturing plant in Struandale Port Elizabeth, the president and representative director of Isuzu Motors of Japan Masanori Katayama said that Isuzu was committed to growing its business in South Africa. “This is the first commercial and light commercial vehicle manufacturing operation outside of Japan in which we have acquired a 100% ownership. We are represented in 30 countries outside of Japan and successfully operate 47 manufacturing plants in these countries with joint venture partners.” “Our decision with regards to South Africa demonstrates the confidence we have in this market and also is indicative of our longer-term view that South Africa will serve as an important base for our future growth on the African continent.”     Read: These are the most reliable car brands for 2018
