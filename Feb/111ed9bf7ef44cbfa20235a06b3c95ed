As part of his 2018 budget, former finance minister Malusi Gigaba announced a 52 cents per litre increase in the General Fuel and Road Accident Fund levy. The General Fuel Levy will increase by 22 cents from R3.15 to R3.37 (7% increase), and the RAF Levy will increase by 30 cents from R1.63 to R1.93 (18% increase). According to the Automobile Association (AA), this increase amounts to a total increase of 11% on the current levies from R4.78 to R5.30. The association said the increases will place an extra burden on all road users, but especially on the poorest of the poor who mostly rely on public transport.
