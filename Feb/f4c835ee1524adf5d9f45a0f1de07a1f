MultiChoice South Africa has issued an open invitation to anyone interested bidders for its proposed new 24-hour black-owned news channel. The bid follows the January announcement that Multichoice will be dropping the Gupta-linked ANN7 news channel from its channel bouquet. “This invitation is only to register an intention to bid, so MultiChoice can assess the level of interest,” it said in a statement on Thursday. “A further, formal invitation to submit bids with details of the process and further guidelines will be shared in mid February.” As part of the bid’s consideration, Multichoice also outlined six requirements that the new channel should meet. These include: Be a South African, predominantly English news channel that takes into account the history, diversity of cultural background, languages and socio-economic circumstances in South Africa.
Broadcast 24 hours per day. Provide anchor- based, live broadcasts in the style of Al Jazeera, CNN, Sky News, ENCA, SABC News and others.
Specifically focus on national, regional, local and African news, actuality, current affairs and sport with some focus on international affairs.
Be owned, managed and operated by an independent Black South African owned entity.
Focus on training and development of news and broadcast industry personnel.
Be independent, non-partisan, unbiased and critical – MultiChoice will have no editorial control or ownership. The channel will be widely distributed on DStv packages, and will also receive funding from MultiChoice and other sources, the media group said. Interested parties can register their intention to bid here. Read: Multichoice is dropping ANN7 – and will replace it with a new black-owned news channel
