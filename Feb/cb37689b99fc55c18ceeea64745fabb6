Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: President Jacob Zuma is expected to respond to his party’s decision to recall him as leader of the country today. The ANC didn’t give Zuma a deadline to accept the decision, but said that it anticipated his response today. Despite reports that Zuma had organised a 10am address at the Union Buildings, there has been no official confirmation of Zuma responding. The Hawks have confirmed that they are executing a raid on the Guptas’ compound in Saxonwold. The purpose of the raid is as yet not known, but it suspected to do with the investigation into the Free State dairy projected, which the family has been heavily implicated in, particularly in the abuse of funds. NPA head Shaun Abrahams says the country will know whether Jacob Zuma will face 783 fraud and corruption charges by 23 February 2018. Abrahams has given prosecutors to that date to make their recommendations in the matter. The Special Investigating Unity has dealt a major blow to former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng, hitting him with summonses amounting to R21 million. The controversial former executive is being hounded to repay a R11 million bonus he gave himself for negotiating a deal with Multichoice, and a further R10.7 million in damages from mismanagement. South Africa’s rand weakened on Tuesday after the ruling African National Congress (ANC) said it had not given President Jacob Zuma a deadline to accept its decision to “recall” him and resign. On Wednesday, the rand was trading at R11.92 to the dollar, R16.58 to the pound and R14.76 to the euro.
