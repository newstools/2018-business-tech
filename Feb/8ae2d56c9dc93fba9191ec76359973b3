Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: Reaction to president Cyril Ramaphosa’s late-night cabinet reshuffle has been mixed, with many welcoming the return of Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister and Pravin Gordhan as public enterprises minister – but others question the president’s motivations in keeping Zuma loyalists, Bathabile Dlamini and Nomvula Mokonyane on the team. Returning finance minister Nhlanhla Nene is coming back to his office determined to turn the economy around – however, he warned that the budget tabled by his predecessor Malusi Gigaba might not be enough to stave off junk status, and said the entire country will need to work hard to reverse the economic woes it faces. NPA head Shaun Abrahams says he has made his decision on whether or not to reinstate charges of corruption against former president Jacob Zuma – however, he will only make this publicly known on 15 March, as he has given the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution two weeks’ notice before announcing it. Petrochemicals group Sasol has announced that ratings group Moody’s has decoupled the company’s credit rating from the South African government – which means it will now be able to borrow money more cheaply than the government, and also attain higher ratings. South Africa’s rand pulled back from three-year highs scaled earlier in Monday’s session as technical factors weighed, while stocks rose with Sasol among the advancers after it posted solid results. On Tuesday the rand was trading at R11.57 to the dollar, R16.16 to the pound and R14.27 to the euro.
