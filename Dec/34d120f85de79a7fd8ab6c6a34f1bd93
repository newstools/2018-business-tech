Uber has launched 24/7 phone support for passengers and drivers across South Africa. The ride hailing app said that users can access the feature by tapping ‘help’ in the main menu of the app and then selecting the ‘call’ option to be connected to Uber’s 24/7 support team. Riders can also contact the Uber support team through the 24/7 in-app messaging feature or visit help.uber.com for frequently asked questions, it said. However, Uber said that riders should still call 10111 or use the in-app emergency button which connects to its third-party security providers. “Our new 24/7 phone support is the latest in a series of improvements we’re making for both riders and drivers,” said Alon Lits, GM for Uber Sub-Saharan Africa. “This follows the new app we’ve introduced for drivers, in-app emergency button as well as Injury Protection cover in the event of an accident On-Trip. We always want to offer the best possible service so we’re going to keep listening to our riders and drivers and make further changes based on their feedback.” Read: Uber price hike for South Africa
