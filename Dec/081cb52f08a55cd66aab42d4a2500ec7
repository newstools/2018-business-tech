15 South African restaurants have been listed among the top 1,200 in the world – with two ranking in the top 200. The restaurants were ranked in the 2019 La Liste, which comprises 1,184 top restaurants around the world, all of which scored 80 points or higher in the group’s analysis. La Liste is inspired by “meta-classifications” used in the academic field (Shanghai ranking), sports (ATP) or other domains (movies, gaming): for each restaurant, the group summarises the evaluations available online or on paper. The ratings assigned by different guides and publications are harmonised and weighted. The result is an overall score between 0 and 100, rounded up to a quarter of a point, which determines the restaurant’s place in the world ranking. A total of 620 sources were used, from the most established ones (Michelin, New York Times, etc) to the most recent ones (Cubapaladar, the first Cuban guide, Chinese “Black Pearl” Guide, etc). Of the 15 South African restaurants listed in the rankings, only two were ranked within the top 200 – The Test Kitchen in Cape Town, and Restaurant Mosaic at the Orient in Pretoria. The Test Kitchen has long been ranked as the top restaurant in South Africa, winning the Mecerdes Benz Eat Out Awards for a number of years. Restaurant Mosaic, meanwhile, has had a record-breaking 2018, with the restaurant and its chef, Chantel Dartnell picking up notable awards and accolades. Mosaic at the Orient was named the Best Fine Dining Restaurant in the country at the 13th annual Restaurant Association of South Africa (RASA) Rosetta Awards. It was also given a RASA Award for innovation, elegance and style of international prestige. The Tourism & Hospitality Counsel of South Africa meanwhile also named Dartnall as Best Chef for 2018, and Restaurant Mosaic as Best Restaurant for 2018. On top of its placing on the La Liste rankings for 2019, Mosaic also received the 2019 La Liste Award for the Best Wine List in the world.
