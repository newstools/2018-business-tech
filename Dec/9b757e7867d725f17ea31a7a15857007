Cell C is providing customers with 1GB of free data to apologise for network downtime on Saturday (1 December), caused by Eskom load shedding. “We want to thank our customers for their patience during the unprecedented network outage earlier today,” it said on Twitter. “To show our appreciation, we will provide each customer with 1GB of data valid for 5 days.” Cell C said it would notify customers when the data will be loaded. The operator’s network went down after a Neotel Data Centre experienced a power surge, which tripped the air-conditioning. This was caused by Eskom’s latest load shedding schedule, which began again this week as the state-owned power company announced that it was cutting between 1,000 and 2,000 megawatts from the grid. “This resulted in the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) system, that enables the routing of traffic on the network, to overheat and power down, Cell C said.
