Johannesburg is known as the economic hub of South Africa, and with the title comes the reputation of paying more to employees than any other major city in the country. Nationwide salary reviews have shown that jobs in Gauteng pay much higher than national average, the reason: consumer prices, utilities, restaurant prices, groceries, and even petrol in some cases is more expensive. Jobs portal CareerJunction has released its latest salary review for 2018, showing how much companies are offering to acquire skills in thousands of jobs – including the regional variations between South Africa’s three major economic areas. In line with its reputation, Gauteng salaries are the highest on average nationally in almost every job category, with Capetonians generally getting paid higher than employees in KwaZulu Natal. The two fields where this is reversed, however, is in warehousing and logistics, and manufacturing and assembly. According to CareerJunction’s data, warehousing and logistic salaries are between 5% and 8% higher (6.5% on average) than the national average in the Western Cape, while only between 5% and 6% higher (5.5% average) in Gauteng. In the field of manufacturing and assembly, the difference is even greater, with the Western Cape’s average salary being 2% to 8% higher (5% on average) than the national value, while Gauteng’s is between 2% and 4% higher (3% on average). In ICT, Gauteng and the Western Cape are evenly matched (averaging 11% higher) – while Gauteng dominates the rest.
