After a number of years of growth, there has been a slight decline in South African coffee consumption in 2017. This is according to Insight Survey’s latest South African Coffee Industry Landscape report which found that in 2016/17 more than 550,000 bags of coffee were consumed – compared to 557,000 bags in 2015/2016. However, this downward trend can be partially explained by the fact that South African consumers have become more discerning in terms of the coffee they consume. According to Dylan Cumming, MD of coffee company Beaver Creek, there is a growing demand for high-end specialty coffee in South Africa. Cumming is of the opinion that consumers want a coffee that is distinct in its character, and they want to know where the coffee is grown. He added that the demand for premium and specialty coffees is clearly increasing in South Africa as consumers’ interest in Nespresso and other capsule and pod-based coffee offerings continue to grow. Specialty coffee preparation methods, such as Aero press are also attracting the attention of many consumers. “Furthermore, the majority of consumers’ interest has moved beyond simply just drinking coffee,” he said. “Many consumers want to have a coffee experience,” said Ryler Masterton, from Masterton’s Coffee and Tea Specialists. He said that local consumers want to know more about coffee, experience greater varieties, and enjoy different experiences. “Younger consumers are increasingly more interested in coffee as well. “Rising affluence and changing consumer tastes have increased the demand for high quality and speciality products, such as flavoured coffee, amongst this group. Millennials are also more likely than other consumers to experiment with new drink types, brands, and flavours.” BusinessTech looked at how the price of coffee compares across seven of South Africa’s most popular coffee shops.
