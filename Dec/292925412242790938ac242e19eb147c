Energy experts have warned that South Africa could be in the dark for several years as Eskom battles coal shortages and high maintenance costs. According to a report by the Sunday Times the power utility has promised that load shedding will subside by March 2019. However, energy experts have indicated that Eskom’s load shedding and financial problems could drag the country into a ‘death spiral’. A report seen by the paper states that coal shortages will continue until 2025, with close to 80% of Eskom power generation currently relying on coal. The power utility is also expected to spend billions of rands on maintenance in 2019 and beyond, as parts of the power system face efficiency issues and even total collapse. Stage 2 load shedding Eskom announced on Saturday (1 December), that it has been forced to implement stage 2 load shedding because of continued pressure on the national grid. Stage 2 calls for 2,000MW to rotationally load shed nationally at a given period. Load shedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. “For South Africans, that means a return to stocking up on candles, mopping up thawed refrigerators and sitting in gridlocked roads around blank traffic lights,” Bloomberg reported. The group also advised that stage 2 load shedding would be implemented from 08h00 to 22h00 on Sunday. Read: Eskom moves to stage 2 load shedding: here’s how it will impact you
