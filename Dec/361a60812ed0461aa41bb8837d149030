MTN Group has advised that it remains in discussions with Nigerian authorities over a $10 billion dispute. Reuters reported that on Tuesday, a court in Lagos adjourned the case between MTN and representatives of Nigeria’s central bank to December 12, after lawyers requested a short adjournment for them to report back to the court on the settlement talks. Shares in MTN declined 3.24% to R83.59 on the JSE on Monday, down from a year high of R140. Nigeria’s central bank accused MTN in late August of illegally repatriating $8.1 billion from the country. MTN has denied any wrongdoing. That was followed by a secondary allegation that the operator owed $2 billion in back taxes, a claim which MTN has said is without merit.
