The Department of Labour has increased the minimum wage payable to South African domestic workers. Published on Monday (3 December), the new minimum wage will take immediate effect and employers will now be responsible for ensuring that they meet the new wages as prescribed by the legislation. This minimum wage will continue until the official introduction of the National Minimum Wage Act which was signed off by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the end of November. While no official indication has been provided as to when this switch will take place, the Act prescribes that the national minimum wage will be R20 per hour worked – with certain exceptions being applicable to farm workers, domestic workers, workers employed on an expanded public works programme. Once the National Minimum Wage Act comes into effect, the domestic sector will then receive 75% of the new national minimum wage  – or R15 per hour worked. Sectoral Determination Department minister Mildred Oliphant announced that in terms of Sectoral Determination 1: the minimum wages will be adjusted upwards for employees in Area A and Area B. Area A refers to large metropolitan municipalities and built up areas and suburbs – Area B is all other municipalities. The full list can be found here.
