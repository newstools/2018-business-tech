Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, has announced the reappointment of the History Ministerial Task Team (MTT) to overhaul the current history curriculum. In a gazette published on Friday (14 December), Motshekga said that the terms of reference of the task team will be as follows: To develop a new History curriculum from Grades 4 -12;
To conduct provincial consultation in the education sector to obtain inputs into the new History Curriculum;
To receive public inputs and comments for consideration, on the new History curriculum;
To screen textbooks to ensure alignment with the new curriculum; and
To propose History Teacher development programmes for both Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and In- Service Teacher Education (reskilling and upskilling). No date was provided as to when the changes will be made or implemented. In May, MyBroadband reported on plans to implement a new history curriculum in local schools over seven years, with the subject also set to become compulsory. Certain academics have welcomed the proposed changes to the history subject in South Africa, as they say the current syllabus downplays aspects like slavery and racism. The destruction of ancient African civilisations has also been omitted under the current syllabus, according to the report.
