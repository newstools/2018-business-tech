Power utility Eskom warned on Monday (3 December) that it has implemented stage 2 load shedding – making it a fourth successive day of blackouts. “With a number of power generating units still out of service due to breakdowns, the prognosis for today is that Eskom will be forced to implement stage 2 load shedding from 09h00 to 22h00 again,” Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said via his Twitter account. Stage 2 load shedding was implement on top of stage 2 load curtailment – where companies are forced to reduce their power consumption – which will also be in effect from 09h00 to 22h00. Stage 2 calls for 2,000MW to rotationally be shed and curtailed nationally for the given period. Eskom warned last week that controlled blackouts could return and last throughout the year. Even more concerning, Bloomberg reported, is that the company expects energy availability of the system will keep declining into early next year and probably only recover to current levels in six months. Eskom’s debt has skyrocketed to R419 billion, amid declining sales volumes. Its generation difficulties are connected to the financial challenges, which limit the amount of maintenance and refurbishments the company can afford to carry out at its fleet of aging power stations. The utility is also running low on coal, Bloomberg said. Where to find the loading shedding schedule:  Read: South Africa facing years of load shedding: report
