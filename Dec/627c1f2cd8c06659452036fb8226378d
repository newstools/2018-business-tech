SABC chairperson, Bongumusa Makhathini, has accused the government of failing to help the struggling national broadcaster by not responding to requests for a government guarantee, reports the Sunday Times. In a 33-page letter, Makhathini, said that he has received little information from the department of communication and the National Treasury despite repeated requests for a cash injection. He added that the SABC board has projected that the broadcaster would run out of money by the end of March. This division came to the forefront after four SABC board members resigned following a meeting with the new communication’s minister last week, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. At the meeting Ndabeni-Abrahams allegedly accused the board of not acting in the best interests of the country and the broadcaster by seeking to retrench some 981 full-time workers and more than 1,000 freelancers. Calling this move ‘unacceptable’, the minster reportedly wants time to negotiate a bailout from Treasury of about R3 billion. However other sources have indicated that the move is a political one, with the minister trying to dissolve the board – seen as impartial and independent for the first time after years of political deployees – ahead of the 2019 elections.
