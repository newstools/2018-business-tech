Given the outlook for interest rates and fuel prices, there are some considerations to inform vehicle purchase decisions into 2019. This is according to Wesbank’s executive head of sales and marketing, Ghana Msibi, who said that there is a good opportunity to look for better offers from manufacturers with clever incentive schemes towards the end of the year. “Also remember that new vehicle prices are expected to increase in January, giving consumers an opportunity to conclude a deal during December at 2018 values and register their vehicle in 2019, thereby taking the extra value in the car when it comes to trading it in. “New vehicles also offer a host of new technologies to improve fuel efficiency, impacting your monthly fuel bill and potential disposable income,” he said.
