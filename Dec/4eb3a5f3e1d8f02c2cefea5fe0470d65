BMW South Africa has announced pricing for its new 3 Series sedan. The group said that only the 320d and 330i models will be made available locally, with pricing starting from R649,253 and rising by a further R3,000 for both derivatives if you opt for the sports transmission. First announced at the Paris Motor Show in October, the 2019, the 3 series features a similar design to past models but is 85 millimetres longer than its predecessor (at 4,709mm), 16 millimetres wider (1,827mm) and just 1 mm taller (1,442 millimetres). At the front, the large BMW kidney grille elements are framed by a single surround and split up by wide bars and link to the headlight units. The customary BMW twin headlights feature the familiar two-way split that is further emphasised by a notch in the front apron that rises into the headlight contour. BMW said that the interior is designed to accentuate the spaciousness of the cabin and the driver-focused cockpit. The instrument panel has a modern, light look with horizontal lines, high-quality electroplated trim strips and contours that extend into the doors. The start/stop button for the engine is now positioned in a control panel in the centre console that houses the gearshift lever or newly designed selector lever, the iDrive controller, electromechanical parking brake and the buttons for the driving experience control switch unit. The entry-level SE model now also features substantially increased technical specifications as standard. It includes extended LED headlights with cornering light and eyebrow indicators, interior ambient lighting with up to 11 colour settings, reversing camera and the latest generation reversing assistant, electric folding rear view mirrors, three-zone air conditioning, and enhanced acoustic glazing.
