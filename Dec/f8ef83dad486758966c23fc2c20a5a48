Former president Jacob Zuma has joined Twitter. In a welcome video posted on his account, Zuma said that he had joined the platform to “join the conversation”, and particularly to engage with people are are talking about him. “Hello everyone, I have decided to move with the times to join this important area of conversation. I hear that many people are talking about me, as well as all these others who are calling themselves in Zuma in many ways,” he said. “I felt it is necessary that I should join in and be part of the conversation and join the people in their conversations. It is me, former president, Jacob Zuma.”  Zuma had previously been on the platform in his official capacity as president of South Africa. His first non-introductory tweet on his new account, called a tweet asking for donations and linking to an account purportedly belonging to him, false. The former president suffered a blow this week after the High Court on Thursday (13 December) ruled that the state must no longer pay his legal fees in the corruption cases against him. The court said that Zuma must pay his own fees, and that the state must recover monies already paid out to defend him in court.
