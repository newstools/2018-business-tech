Power utility Eskom said on Tuesday that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding, again because of a shortage of power grid capacity. This represents a fifth consecutive day of stage 2 shedding, with Eskom asking residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during load-shedding periods. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe told Jacaranda radio that the grid is expected to be under strain until the week of the 16th of December. “The reason for this is that during that period, many companies like industrial customers that use a lot of electricity – like the mines and large industrial customers – close down for the holiday period. “We will use that period to recover in terms of getting our water and diesel reserves up again and we will do the requisite maintenance for the units which are offline now,” he said.  Energy experts have warned that South Africa could be in the dark for several years as Eskom battles coal shortages and high maintenance costs. According to a report by the Sunday Times the power utility has promised that load shedding will subside by March 2019. However, energy experts have indicated that Eskom’s load shedding and financial problems could drag the country into a ‘death spiral’. A report seen by the paper stated that coal shortages will continue until 2025, with close to 80% of Eskom power generation currently relying on coal.
