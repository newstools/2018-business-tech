With the UK currently navigating around the impact of Brexit, a number of proposed changes should make it easier for South Africans to live and work in the country. Speaking to BusinessTech, JP Breytenbach, director of Breytenbachs Immigration Consultants, said that it has not become any easier, or more difficult, for South Africans to emigrate to the UK recently. However, he noted that there may be good news in the pipeline. “The loom of Brexit, and subsequent changes to the UK immigration rules and regulations might bring welcome news for South Africans,” he said. “The Migration Advisory Committee has recently made recommendations that the free movement for EU citizens should end after Brexit. They also proposed that the current Tier 2 work permit scheme be broadened to allow medium-skilled workers to work in the UK. “This is of course very good news for South Africans, as there will be more job opportunities in the UK, coupled with broader immigration routes allowing South Africans to take up more job opportunities.” He added that the new Seasonal Agricultural Worker Scheme will be implemented in the British Spring 2019, and will bring welcome opportunities for lower-skilled South Africans to work in the UK for up to six months. “Breytenbachs believes that the proposed expansion of the Tier 2 immigration route to include medium-skilled workers, will open up more immigration route possibilities for medium to higher skilled South Africans,” he said. “The proposed ending of free movement of EU workers will also mean more job opportunities in the UK.” However, Breytenbach cautioned that before making the move, proper planning in relation to any immigration matter is absolutely key. “It is always a good idea to rather do your research properly taking into account all the various factors unique to you and your family and then – once you have planned your move as much as possible – to take the leap,” he said.
