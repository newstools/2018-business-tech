The Sunday Times has released its Top Brands survey for 2018. The survey was split into two main segments – ‘consumer’ and ‘business’ – with seperate winners named based on each participant groups. The consumer survey was based on the findings of more than 3,500 face-to-face interviews conducted with adults in metro and non-metro areas of South Africa.
