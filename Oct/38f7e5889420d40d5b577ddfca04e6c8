Mercedes-Benz recently announced pricing for its first V6 double-cab bakkie in South Africa – the X350d 4MATIC. The bakkie will be available in two variants – the ‘Progressive’ which is aimed at people seeking a rugged double cab with extra styling and comfort functions, and the ‘Power’ which Mercedes said will act as the high-end line. While the Progressive variant (R904,188) will be slightly cheaper than the Power version (R973,188), it is clear that Mercedes is targeting upper income-levels with both models, and motorists can expect to pay well over R1 million if they include add-ons. Despite the popularity of Mercedes-Benz, the luxury model is unlikely to challenge the country’s two runaway success stories in this market – the Toyota Hilux and Ford Ranger. Toyota and Ford’s models continue to dominate the bestseller’s list in 2018, while other familiar names such as the Volkswagen Amarok and Nissan Navara are tailored toward the top end of the market. With a wide range of options available, BusinessTech looks at the cheapest and most expensive double cab models from the country’s leading manufacturers.
