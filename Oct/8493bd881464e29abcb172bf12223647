[Mail & Guardian] Gauteng premier David Makhura says the DA needs to focus on the City of Tshwane, which is the worst-run metro in the province, instead of “wasting time” with motions of no confidence in Ekurhuleni. The DA failed to pass a motion of no confidence in mayor Mzwandile Masina.

On Friday the rand was at R14.65 to the dollar, R18.79 to the pound and R16.66 to the euro.
