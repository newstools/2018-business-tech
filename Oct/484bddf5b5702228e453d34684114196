FNB says it has extended the number of branches connected to WiFi to 603, from 383 branches since February 2017 as part of a drive to enable customers to bank digitally. Lee-Anne van Zyl, CEO of FNB Points of Presence, said: “the expansion of WiFi connectivity across our branch network is primarily aimed at giving customers easy access to digital banking platforms. The bank is seeing an increase in the number of customers migrating to digital platforms at branches and opting to use the app, online and cellphone banking.” When customers access banking services digitally there’s a direct impact on the amount of time they spend in the branch. The bank said it has also seen an increase in the number of customers using its Digi Zones within branches, these are designated areas within a branch where customers can access their online banking profiles. “The adoption of digital banking channels is not only about cost effectiveness, it’s also about making sure we use technology to drive financial inclusion. Secondly, it’s about making sure customers continue to enjoy an array of banking options one of which is digital banking,” said van Zyl.
