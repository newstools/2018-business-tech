Wits Universityâ€™s free, online learning platform, WitsX, has released a new course aimed specifically at professionals in the information technology field. Digital technologies are no longer the exclusive domain of the IT department, and IT can no longer be viewed simply as a support function within organisations. The Digital Transformation and the IT team course will help IT professionals understand what digital transformation truly means, how it impacts organisations, how it changes the role of the IT team, and reorient their thinking to a digital business approach. This course explores the movement from an IT paradigm to a digital business technology (BT) paradigm. It also provides a deep view of the environment of simultaneous chaos and order in organisations that are rapidly digitising. Finally, learners will learn about the impact that digital transformation has on the role of IT and CIO teams. This information is critically needed by both IT and business professionals who are reorienting themselves towards a digital business approach, Wits said. The course runs from 7 November to 5 December 2018. Read: UCT launches new online fintech short-course
