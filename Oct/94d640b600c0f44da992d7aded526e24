Ride-hailing service Taxify has significantly expanded its South African operations by announcing the launch of services in the cities of Polokwane in Limpopo, and East London in the Eastern Cape. The announcement follows the completion of a $175 million investment round, which Taxify said that it intended to use this investment to expand its services worldwide – particularly across Africa. Taxify began operating in South Africa in 2016 in Johannesburg, and with the launch of Polokwane and East London this month will operate in eight South African cities – including Tshwane, Ekurhuleni, Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth. This means that the ride-hailing service now operates in more cities across South Africa than it does in any of the other more than 25 countries where it has a presence. The company employs over 80 permanent staff in South Africa and is set to increase that number over the next couple of years as it expands further. “Demand for ride-hailing services is growing across South Africa as public transport is increasingly unreliable and the costs of car ownership soar,” said Gareth Taylor, Taxify’s country manager for South Africa. “Ride hailing services like Taxify make it possible for more people to enjoy the convenience and safety of getting from one place to another, without the costs of car ownership or the inconvenience of public transport,” he said. Taxify services in Polokwane will begin on Wednesday (3 October), with operations in East London set to commence later this month. Read: Uber to pay settlement over data breach
