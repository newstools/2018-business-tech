Volkswagen has picked up five of the 11 categories at the 2018 Gumtree Auto Pre-Owned Awards announced on Monday evening (8 October 2018). Toyota, Mazda and Audi also enjoyed strong showings with two wins each, Gumtree said. The awards, now in their second year, are unique in South Africa in their recognition of vehicles which deliver resale value, quality, durability, overall performance and economy for pre-owned buyers. Gumtree pointed out that only 2016 models with at least six months of depreciation data were considered and five finalists in each of the 11 categories were extensively judged by an expert panel. Volkswagen swept the hatchback and sedan categories up to R300,000, winning the ‘Budget City Car’ category with the Take Up, the’ Light Hatchback’ category with the Polo Vivo, the ‘Medium Sedan’ category with the Jetta, and the ‘Medium Hatchback’ category with the Golf 1.4TSI. Volkswagen’s fifth winner was the Golf R, which shared top spot in ‘Performance Car under R615,000’ with the Audi S3-S-Tronic. This was the closest contested category with the third-placed BMW 240i a mere 10 points adrift of the joint winners. Audi scored its second triumph in the ‘Medium-sized Luxury Sedan under R550,000’ category with the A4 2.0TDI S-Tronic which narrowly beat the BMW 330D. Toyota dominated in the SUV categories – the Fortuner winning ‘SUVs under R505,000’ and the Hilux taking ‘4×2 Double Cabs under R460,000’. Mazda’s CX3 won the ‘Cross-overs under R325,000’ in convincing fashion in the only category with a unanimous winner among all 11 judges. Mazda also took the ‘SUVs under R330,000’ with the CX5 2.0 Active model. Jaguar won the ‘Luxury SUVs under R700,000’ category with the very attractively styled F-Pace. Three of the 2018 winners were repeating their 2017 triumphs – Volkswagen Golf 1.4TSI Trendline, Volkswagen Golf R and the Mazda CX3 2.0 Individual, Gumtree said.
