He is also a Fellow of the Actuarial Society of South Africa. He joined Sanlam in 1993 and rapidly progressed into senior leadership and executive positions in various Sanlam business units. Previous positions, inter alia, include CEO of Sanlam Structured Solutions and since 2013 as the CEO of Sanlam Employee Benefits. According to  Alexander Forbes, de Villiers has a wealth of experience in the employee benefits and investment management industry and “believes that the employee benefits industry can have a huge influence in South Africa by really changing people’s lives through enabling financial peace of mind”.
