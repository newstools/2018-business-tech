The City of Cape Town and Cell C have has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which could pave the way for the expansion of public access Wi-Fi locations across the city. In a statement on Tuesday (30 October), Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille said that the MOU proposes giving Cell C access to City street pole infrastructure, council-owned buildings and public spaces. She added that Cell C’s proposal will include possibly installing Wi-Fi access points on these street light poles buildings, bus stops, terminals and public transport hubs. “Cell C is always looking at ways to bring access to as many South Africans as we can,”  said Cell C CEO, Jose Dos Santos on he signing of the MOU, “We know that this project will assist us in our mission to connect those who have not been able to access Wi-Fi before.” De Lille added that she firmly believed that there is a positive correlation between the availability of internet access and the social and economic upliftment of communities. “Internet access and digital literacy are widely recognised as enablers of economic participation and improved educational outcomes. “For this administration, digital inclusion is important and in this regard we have already rolled out more than 890 km of fibre optic cables and connected over 300 City-owned buildings with Wi-Fi that is accessible to our residents,” she said.
