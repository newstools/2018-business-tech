Volkswagen has announced it new T-Cross – the company’s first small car SUV. Volkswagen said that the T-Cross is shorter and therefore better suited to the city than the T–Roc, and even more compact than the Tiguan. The new T-Cross has a choice of four turbocharged engines: three petrol and one diesel. The two 1.0 TSI three-cylinder petrol engines with petrol particulate filter generate 70 kW / 95 PS or 85 kW / 115 PS. The top model is the 1.5 TSI four-cylinder engine with 110 kW/150 PS. Completing the range is a 1.6 TDI four-cylinder engine with 70 kW/95 PS. Standard equipment for the new T-Cross includes numerous driver assistance systems which were previously reserved for higher vehicle classes, Volkswagen said. Already included as standard equipment are the Front Assist area monitoring system with Pedestrian Monitoring and City Emergency Braking System, the lane keeping assistant Lane Assist, Hill Start Assist, the proactive occupant protection system, and the Blind Spot Detection lane change assist system with the integrated Rear Traffic Alert. Pricing and availability details will be made available at a later date.     Read: A look at the new limited-edition ‘invincible’ Toyota Hilux
