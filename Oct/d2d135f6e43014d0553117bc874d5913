South African consumers have had to endure a torrid time in 2018 when it comes to rising petrol prices, with the most recent hike taking prices to record highs. The knock-on effect of rising fuel prices can include an increase in inflation as the cost of goods will be far more expensive due to freight costs, while motorists have less money in their pockets and are therefore forced to change their driving habits. According to a poll of 2,953 BusinessTech readers, 76% of motorists (2,246) say that this latest petrol price will now directly impact their driving habits. BusinessTech looked at the most popular cars (September 2018), that are also the cheapest to drive – based on their average fuel consumption data.
