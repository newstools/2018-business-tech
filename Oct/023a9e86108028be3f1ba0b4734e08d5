Twitter has launched a new setting which will enable users on iOS and Android to save data while they browse. “With data saver, images will load in a smaller size, allowing them to load more quickly and autoplay videos are disabled,” said Jesar Shah, product manager at Twitter. “This enables you to consume less data and have more control over your data usage. You can turn data saver mode on or off in data usage settings on iOS and Android. The feature is also currently available on Twitter Lite.” Shah explained that people will still be able to access high-quality images with the setting turned on. “If people want to see images in higher quality with data saver on, they simply tap the more icon and select ‘Load High Quality.’” Free Twitter The announcement follows a recent decision made by MTN to cancel its ‘free’ Twitter service. Speaking to MyBroadband, Jacqui O’Sullivan, executive for corporate affairs at MTN SA, said that one of the big reasons why the network was ultimately stopping its free Twitter service was abuse by a small group of users. “We capped usage of the free Twitter service at 500MB because of the exploitation by a handful of users,” she said. “These users were using the unlimited free data on downloads and other platforms. “This meant huge files and videos were being transferred via ‘tunnelling’, which was never the intention behind the free Twitter service.” Read: MTN ends free Twitter service
