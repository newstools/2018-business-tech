The South African Revenue Services (SARS) has released its annual report for 2017/2018. Collections for the 2017/18 financial year amounted to R1 216.5 billion, which is R843 million or less than 1% below the revised target of R1 217.3 billion. The group also published the average wage, among its headcount of more than 13,000 people. According to the Free Market Foundation, the average civil servant in South Africa earns about R328,000 per annum but this varies by occupation and location. As it stands, the government wage bill of R587 billion is almost a full third of the annual budget. In essence, government – which employs over 2 million people on the national, provincial and local level – is spending more on wages than the economy can keep up with. According to SARS’ annual report, its average employee earned a salary of R487,270, with top management earning R3.7 million. Quarterly data from StatsSA showed that the average monthly salary in the formal non agricultural sector amounted to R20,176, or R242,112, per annum.
