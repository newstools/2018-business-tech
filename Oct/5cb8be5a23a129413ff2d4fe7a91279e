Jaguar has revealed pricing for the upcoming I-Pace in South Africa. Built from the ground up, the new Jaguar I‑Pace is a pure Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), making it one of the few that will be available in South Africa alongside Nissan’s Leaf and BMW’s i Series. The all-electric SUV will be available in three trim grades including S, SE and HSE, while a limited run of First Edition models will act as range-toppers for one year only. All variants come with identical powertrains comprising a 90kWh battery positioned in the floor for a low centre of gravity, and two axle-mounted synchronous electric motors paired with concentric single speed transmissions. Its 294kW/696Nm peak power is enough to launch the all-wheel drive SUV from 0-100km/h in 4.8 seconds, and a single full charge provides a range of up to 470km on the WLTP cycle – more than enough to cover the average weekly commute of 300km. Inside the 5-seater you can expect a host of new technologies – including two touchscreens, a 4G Wi-Fi Hotspot, and smart settings which can select preferred seat and mirror positions and play your preferred media at the start of each journey.     Pricing Pricing (including VAT) is detailed for the various models below: Jaguar I-PACE S – R1,687,200 Jaguar I-PACE SE – R1,745,400 Jaguar I-PACE HSE – R1,820,900 Jaguar I-PACE First Edition – R1,920,700 Jaguar said that pricing for home charging stations will be announced closer to the time of launch in early 2019. It added that home charging cables compatible with normal wall sockets come as standard equipment. Read: Jaguar unveils new I-Pace electric SUV
