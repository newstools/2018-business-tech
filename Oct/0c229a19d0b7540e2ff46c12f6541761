The Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) has released its latest on-time statistics for 2018. The statistics look at the departure times of South Africa’s most prominent local carriers, across the country’s three biggest airports. “Airport operational efficiency is measured through different measures, with on-time performance being the primary internationally accepted standard,” Acsa explained. “On-time performance is measured by comparing the actual off-block time (when aircraft pushes back) against the airline schedule time for a departing flight. “The measurement is done in accordance with the IATA (International Airlines Transport Association) universal standard benchmark which considers a 15-minute deviation from the scheduled time as an on-time departure. “The on-time performance of the airlines is then averaged for a specific airport to produce the on-time performance for the airport,” it said.
