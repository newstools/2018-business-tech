Gauteng will stop walk-in bookings at all its driving licence testing centres (DLTCs), with close to 50% of driving licence application bookings already being made online. In a statement published on the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) website on Sunday (21 October), the Gauteng Department of Transport said that out of 108,554 people who made applications last week, 48,205 used the online booking system. This follows the official launch of an online booking system in August, which enables applicants to schedule the date and time at which they intend to take learner licence or driving licence tests. It also enables users to renew their driving licence cards as well as public driver’s permits. Following this successful launch, the department said that it has decided that all booking applications will be done exclusively online with effect from 1 November 2018. The Tshwane Metro Council has taken a similar decision – moving its services to an online platform with effect from October. “Before the introduction of the online service, applicants were required to travel to a driving licence testing centre and queue for between 140-180 minutes depending on what time they arrive in order to book a time slot,” the department said. “With the introduction of the online service, applicants are able to make their bookings in the comfort of their homes even after hours and weekends. The online service takes the applicant between 5-10 minutes depending on the speed with which the applicant is able to type and the available capacity at the DLTC.” “If a preferred time slot is not available at the first DLTC, the applicant can quickly search for the available slot at any other participating centre,” it said.
