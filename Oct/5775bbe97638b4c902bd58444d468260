Listed IT service management company 4Sight Holdings has announced that Antonie van Rensburg will move from his role as group chief executive officer (CEO) to chief digital officer effective 31 December 2018. The decision comes amid greater-than-expected demand for industry 4.0 solutions, as it will enable Van Rensburg to focus on and drive the group’s digital transformation strategy, the company said. “Our work in the market over the last 17 months has revealed robust demand for industry 4.0 skills and expertise as customers realise the power of digital transformation. I will therefore focus on expanding our digital solution capabilities and will drive these initiatives forward to meet customer requirements across the company’s three industry-specific business sectors.” 4Sight’s current chief financial officer (CFO), Jacques Hattingh, will assume the day-to-day operational duties and responsibilities of the CEO role, until the board completes its task of identifying and appointing a suitable successor, in line with the group’s international growth strategy. Van Rensburg remains on the board in a joint-CEO capacity until the end of 2018 to ensure continuity. Read: JSE-listed 4Sight acquires AccTech and Dynamics Africa for R150 million
