The City of Ekhuruleni will push ahead with plans to expropriate land without compensation, the Associated Press reports. The move effectively means that the municipality will be the first to challenge Section 25 of the Constitution. “We were the first to launch the Rapid Land Release Programme and now we want to be the first metro in Gauteng to expropriate land without compensation for the purposes of human settlement‚” said Ekhuruleni mayor Mzwandile Masina, speaking to TimesLive. “It is important to note that expropriation can never be a means to an end‚ but it has to inherently serve a particular purpose of interest. “To ensure strict compliance to Section 25 of the constitution‚ the first step was to exclude any hint of arbitrariness and/or unreasonableness in our action‚ including assessment of the possibility of an alternative property or availability of less invasive means.” According to AP, Ekurhuleni plans to expropriate about 865 acres (350 hectares) of land in the city limits, both private and government-owned. It is estimated that some 600,000 of the municipality’s nearly four million people are living in informal settlements. The four areas reportedly targeted for expropriation include: 4.4 hectares privately-owned farm in Rietfontein;
101.2 hectares privately-owned plot in Elandsfontein;
205 hectares government-owned plot in Benoni;
33.6 hectares privately-owned farm in Driefontein. Read: It could take 200 years and R600 billion to process South Africa’s current land claims
