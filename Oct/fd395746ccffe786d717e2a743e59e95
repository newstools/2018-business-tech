Woolworths has announced that it will remove single-use plastic bags from one of its stores as part of a six-month trial period. From November, the retailer will not offer any plastic bags at its Steenberg store in Cape Town, with customers needing to either bring their own bag, or pay R5.50 for a reusable one, Reuters reported. Woolworths’ head of sustainability Feroz Koor said research had shown that the levy introduced in 2003 has not curbed the country’s plastic shopping bag consumption. He said the retailer aims to phase out plastic bags by 2020. “When you consider that Woolworths currently sells about 140 million plastic bags a year, which is between six to seven tonnes of plastic, helping consumers choose reusable bags will make a significant impact on reducing plastic waste,” Koor said in a statement.
