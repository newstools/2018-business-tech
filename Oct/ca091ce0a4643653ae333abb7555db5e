The new Ford Mustang Bullitt has been confirmed for local introduction next year, in limited numbers. The limited-edition gets an upgraded performance-tuned 5.0-liter V8 engine that delivers 480 horsepower, pushing it to a top speed exceeding 260 kilometres per hour. The new Mustang Bullitt is equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission with rev matching, and the gear shifter features a white cue ball shift knob in a nod to the original. Bullitt combines elements of Mustang GT Premium and Performance Package content into a unique sports car that maintains the original Bullitt’s understated persona, Ford said. An active valve performance exhaust system is standard, with new black NitroPlateT exhaust tips, ‘retuned to give the car its signature burble. A new open-air induction system and Shelby GT350 intake manifold help deliver optimal performance’. Other standard equipment includes a heated leather steering wheel and 12-inch all-digital LCD instrument cluster, identical in function to the cluster introduced on 2018 Mustang, but with a unique Bullitt welcome screen that starts with an image of the car rather than the standard pony. “This new Bullitt is my favorite Mustang,” said Darrell Behmer, Mustang chief designer. “With zero stripes, spoilers or badges, it doesn’t need to shout. It’s just cool, like Steve McQueen.” Exterior paint choices are limited to Shadow Black and classic Dark Highland Green. Other features paying tribute to the car McQueen drove are subtle chrome accents around a unique black honeycomb grille and side windows, classic five spoke heritage 19-inch aluminum wheels and red-painted BremboT brake calipers with larger rotors. The leather-trimmed interior features unique green accent stitching on the dashboard, door panels, center console and seats. Local pricing and spec levels will be confirmed closer to local introduction.  Read: A look at the new Ford Mustang Bullitt
