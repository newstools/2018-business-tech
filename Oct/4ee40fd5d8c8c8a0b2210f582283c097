Toyota recently announced that it would be launching the limited-edition Hilux Invincible 50 in celebration of the bakkie’s 50th anniversary. The Hilux has remained a firm favourite in South Africa over the years, with 30,524 already sold in South Africa in 2018 – equating to about 30% of total Toyota sales for 2018 year-to-date. “The Hilux’s evolutionary progress through the generations has produced a vehicle with the ideal combination of superlative off-road driving manners, car-like refinement, plus rugged workhorse credentials,” said senior VP of Toyota South Africa Motors, Calvyn Hamman. “More than perhaps any other Hilux generation, this seventh iteration has seen numerous, successive improvements throughout its life, each of which has enabled the model to consistently exceed consumer needs and assure its place right at the top of the sales charts.” To see just how far the Hilux has come over the past 50 years, BusinessTech looked at the past seven generations of models below.
