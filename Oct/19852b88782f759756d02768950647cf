The Department of Social Development has officially published the controversial Children’s Amendment Bill for public comment. While the bill aims to introduce a number of changes to the current Children’s Act – including regulating unmarried fathers, adoption, and surrogate motherhood – arguably the most notable change is how child discipline will be considered under South African law. Section 12A of the Act reads: As an extension of this, the common law defence of reasonable chastisement has been abolished. Upon being reported for violating this section, the parent must be referred to a prevention and early intervention programme. When prevention and early intervention services have failed, or are deemed to be inappropriate, and the child’s safety and wellbeing is at risk, a designated social worker must assess the child. The section also notes that the Department of Social Development must take all reasonable steps to implement education and awareness-raising programmes concerning these new rules.
