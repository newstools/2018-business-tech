Credit Suisse has published its Global Wealth Report for 2018, showing the breakdown of wealth in South Africa, and what it takes to be a 1% earner. According to the report, approximately 61,000 South Africans are part of the global 1%, representing a tiny fraction (0.2%) of the 35.434 million adults in the country. South Africa has high levels of inequality when it comes to the distribution of wealth, with the country’s top 10% of wealth holders controlling 68% of the total $786 billion wealth (ie, 3.5 million people have $534.5 billion in wealth). But this imbalanced distribution becomes more alarming the further it is broken down. The top 5% control 57.8% of the wealth ($867 billion) – while the top 1%, controls 36.4% of the wealth ($546 billion).
