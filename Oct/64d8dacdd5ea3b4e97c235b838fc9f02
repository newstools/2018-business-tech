Retailer Pick n Pay is preparing for its biggest Black Friday ever. This is according to John Bradshaw, head of marketing at Pick n Pay, who confirmed to BusinessTech that the retailer’s plans for 23 November are already well underway. Black Friday has quickly become the biggest shopping day of the year in South Africa, with retailers across the country reportedly seeing more than twice the daily average transactions compared to a standard shopping day. Bradshaw acknowledged that Black Friday is a big day for Pick n Pay, and that a number of arrangements have been made in preparation. “We are working very hard to make sure our customers get the best deals on the biggest day of the year,” he said. “We have also made special arrangements to get more stock than ever before.” Bradshaw added that Pick n Pay is looking to ensure that its deals and savings are bigger and better than Black Friday 2017. This will include deals that will apply across a variety of categories – both in-store and on Pick n Pay’s online store, he said. The retailer stood out for its Black Friday deals in 2017 where it primarily focused on TVs, gadgets, smartphones, and household products. Pick n Pay Hypermarkets also opened earlier on the day (7:00). However, Bradshaw did not disclose specific details on Pick n Pay’s 2018 Black Friday deals – with the company expected to release more information closer to the time. “Customers should watch our website www.pnp.co.za for more details about our deals and the surprises we have planned to maximise Black Friday savings for all our customers,” he said.
