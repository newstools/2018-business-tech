Absa has officially launched its ‘New To Bank’ service. New To Bank allows new customers – who are South African ID holders over the age of 18 – to ‘download’ a cheque account from the app store and start using that account within minutes. The account will be active immediately, and customers will be able to sign-up for rewards and order their physical bank cards for collection in-branch. The process takes place entirely within the Absa app which has been updated to allow both new and current customers to sign in. Customers are asked a number of questions (such as how much they earn before tax), at which point they will be offered a number of cheque account options. Users will then be asked to fill out personal details and take a number of selfies to verify their identity. Absa said that its technology can pick up that a ‘live, moving’ person is taking selfies to open an account and that every customer will be given a separate set of instructions for fraud prevention purposes. Customers will also be able to set up a number of security features to protect their account including biometrics, fingerprints and password. Absa said that the service would officially roll-out to customers within the next few days, and will be available to download on both the iOS and Android app stores. Speaking at an event in Sandton on Thursday (18 October), Aupa Monyatsi, head of customer network africa at the Barclays Africa Group said that this technology was truly new and was not like similarly-focused services currently offered by competitors that require you to still fill out paperwork. He added that Absa has continued to focus on a number of innovations since undergoing a major corporate rebranding earlier this year. Chief amongst these was the launch of fully integrated ChatBanking on WhatsApp, with over 10,000 customers signing up to the service within the first three weeks of its launch.
