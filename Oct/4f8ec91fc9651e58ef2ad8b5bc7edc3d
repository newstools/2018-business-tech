Several passengers were reportedly robbed in mid-air aboard an SAA flight between Johannesburg and Hong Kong. According to a report by TimesLive, the criminals targeted cash and jewellery with passengers informing cabin crew that their valuables – stowed in the overhead compartments – had gone missing. However, the valuables later mysteriously turned up on some of the cabin seats after police in Hong Kong boarded the aircraft when it landed and searched some passengers who had behaved suspiciously. SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali confirmed to TimesLive that incident occurred on flight SA 286 on Monday (1 October). “Two passengers approached our crew complaining that they had lost their valuables (money and a watch)‚” said Tlali. “One of the complainants was able to point out a few passengers who had behaved in a suspicious manner in the cabin and who were seen opening some overhead compartments while other passengers were sleeping.” He added that after the passengers disembarked from the plane in Hong Kong, the suspects identified were ordered to remain in the aircraft and were searched by the police in Hong Kong‚ In 2016, a series of social media posts went viral after an SAA passenger took pictures of a mid-flight robbery. The passenger who witnessed the theft spoke to News24, saying she saw the suspects open overhead lockers and go through economy-class passengers’ baggage.
