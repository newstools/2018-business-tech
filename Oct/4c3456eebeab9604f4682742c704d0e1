Moving abroad boosts the average worker’s income by $21,000, with the best-paid staff found in Switzerland, the US and Hong Kong. That’s the conclusion in a survey showing that 45% of expats said their existing job paid more internationally and 28% changed locations for a promotion. In Switzerland, famous for both sky-high mountains and prices, the annual income boost totaled $61,000. Expat salaries there averaged $203,000 per year – twice the global level.

In HSBC’s annual Expat Explorer, Singapore topped the ranking as best place to live and work for a fourth straight year, beating New Zealand, Germany and Canada.
