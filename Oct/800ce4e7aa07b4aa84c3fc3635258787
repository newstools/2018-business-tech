Listed developer Attacq has partnered with property development company, Tricolt, to launch the first high-rise luxury apartments in Waterfall City. The development is comprised of four towers – the Newton, Kepler, Da Vinci and Galileo – totalling 590 apartments. The first phase of development is set to be completed by 2021 – with apartment prices ranging from R1.49 million to R12 million. The options include everything from one-bedroom apartments (starting from 44 m2) to three-bedroom duplex penthouses, offering up to 327 m2 of living space – including private rooftop gardens and heated pools. Residents will also have access to ‘The Luna Club’, an exclusive multi-concept lifestyle destination for Ellipse Waterfall residents of all ages with premium wellness, fine dining, business and leisure services at their front door. “For Attacq, our focus is to provide capital growth and distributable earnings by leveraging our four value drivers, the most notable of which is our Waterfall development,” said Melt Hamman, CEO of Attacq. “Ellipse represents a natural next step as we look to diversify the residential offering within Waterfall City and expand on our work, live, play value proposition.” “Valued at R1.2 billion, and located in the heart of the city, Ellipse Waterfall will provide secure, lock-up-and-go type convenience whether bought as a home or buy-to-let investment,” said Tim Kloeck, CEO of Tricolt.
