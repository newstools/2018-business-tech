Integrated ICT and infrastructure provider, Vox, has introduced a comprehensive IT advisory portfolio to assist medium-to large-sized businesses review current IT strategies or set new ones, particularly making the shift from on-premise to the cloud. The portfolio includes an IT alignment audit, a cloud readiness assessment and a virtual CIO service and aims to bridge the gap between business and IT to improve financial performance or market competitiveness, Vox said. Areas of focus for the audit include enterprise architecture, network topology, connectivity, voice, security, continuity, redundancy, IT asset utilisation, software versions status, and more. “A key component is the cloud assessment, we will come into your organisation, use software to run an assessment on your entire hardware environment, and get detailed information on application server utilisation, software applications and versions, bandwidth usage, and more,” said Craig Freer, executive head: cloud at Vox. “The outcome is a comprehensive report and a one-on-one technical analysis of the businesses IT environment with one of our virtual CIOs, offering companies detailed recommendations to reduce risk, and guidelines that should be followed in order to achieve best practice within the organisation,” said Freer. Despite the prevalent economic challenges, the IDC says that IT spending by organisations in South Africa has grown at a faster rate than GDP over the past year, with cloud computing and services driving a large part of this. Research from the company shows that cloud is expected to grow by over 20% annually to reach R11.5 billion by 2022. Vox uses the information from the audit to produce a total cost of ownership comparison to demonstrate the gains that can be made by making the shift to cloud computing, as a cloud architecture blueprint and implementation roadmap that brings together a public, private and/or hybrid cloud solution for the business.
