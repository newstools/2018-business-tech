Liquid Telecom SA has announced a new digitally-enhanced operating model – which includes the automation of many tasks for which people are currently responsible. In a statement on Monday (1 October), the company said that this new operating model, coupled with increased automation, will see retrenchments taking place at the telecoms operator. “Our adoption of technologies has resulted in the company contemplating structural changes that supports a digitally enhanced operating model,” it said. “The change may result in a reduction of the company’s full-time staff complement. “We have already informed all staff members of the decision and our main priority will be to support our people over the forthcoming weeks as we go through the consultation process. “Through this transition period, Liquid Telecom remains committed to building Africa’s digital future and collaborating with our customers to connect, innovate and grow throughout their entire digitization journey,” it said. Speaking to MyBroadband about the new operating model, Liquid Telecom SA CEO Reshaad Sha said it was a result of an assessment of the company’s existing business. He explained that the assessment found areas that were not optimally suited for their business, which necessitated a change in the way the company operates. Read: Liquid Telecom in possible IPO
