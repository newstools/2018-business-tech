Kellogg’s recently drew the ire of South Africans following a change in the formula of its most popular cereals, Rice Krispies, which almost tripled the sugar content in the product. The new Rice Krispies has been reformulated to contain less rice, more sugar and an added vanilla flavour. This has pushed the total sugar content of the product from 8 grams of sugar per 100g, to over 21 grams of sugar per 100g. While the move has not been popular among commentators online, Rice Krispies are still far from the worst sugar offenders among popular South African cereal brands. BusinessTech looked at 30 cereals you will find on store shelves, and found out which packs the biggest sugar punch. When BusinessTech last looked at sugar in cereals, the worst offender was Kellogg’s Coco Pops, which had a sugar content of 36 grams per 100g. However, the cereal has since reduced the sugar content – though it remains high on the list. The cereal maker still has a brand as the top contender however, with Kellogg’s Frosties having increased its sugar content to make up 37.4 grams per 100g (in 2015, it was just at 22 grams). Bokomo’s Otee’s Mixed Berries had the second highest sugar content among the cereals we assessed, with 33.5 grams of sugar per 100g – followed closely by Kellogg’s Strawberry Pops and Kellogg’s Coco Pops, (33.1 grams each). The table below outlines the nutritional information of 30 popular cereals in South Africa, ranked by the highest sugar content per 100 grams. The recommended serving size for a bowl of cereal is 30 grams, and the details below do not account for added milk or sugar, which can significantly change the sugar content. However, the grams of sugar per 100 grams can be interpreted as a percentage – thus a the worst offenders (33 grams per 100 grams) can be read as one third of any serving size being sugar.
