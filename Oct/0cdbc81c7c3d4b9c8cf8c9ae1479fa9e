The Sandton skyline is expected to feature an additional stand-out development in the form of a 27-storey Saxony Sandton, expected to launch soon. Labelled by the developers as the “Rolls Royce” of luxury apartments, the Saxony will feature 397 suites that all “exude penthouse grandeur”. Sales for the project will launch on 17 November 2018, with 2 and 3-bedroom apartments featuring alongside 3 and 4-bedroom penthouses. The R2 billion development is being orchestrated by Saxony Developments, who have created a host of developments on Durban’s north coast – most notably in Sibaya, Ballito and Zimbali. “The Saxony Sandton will be defined by the exceptional detail including the use of natural light, custom Italian designer kitchens, refined finishes and advanced smart home technology. This is aptly the ‘Rolls Royce’ of apartment living in the heart of Africa’s richest square mile,” the group said. Apartments start at R3.2 million.
