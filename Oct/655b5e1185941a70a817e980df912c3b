The Gupta family allegedly offered former Free State economic development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana R2 million every month for 10 years to help secure control over a R41.9 billion project to build a new city in the Free State. This is according to the City Press, following an interview with Dukwana, who made the claim. Dukwana told the paper that he was presented with a letter by Tony Gupta, prepared on his behalf that only needed his signature, in order to gain control over the $2.9 billion project to build a “city of tomorrow” in the Lejweleputswa District Municipality in the Free State. To sweeten the deal, Dukwana alleged that he was offered R2 million on the spot, and R2 million for each month the project was ongoing – projected at 10 years. He said that he declined the offer. According to the report, Dukwana is willing to assist the Zondo Commission into state capture with the allegations, and provide information implicating current ANC secretary general Ace Magashule in the deal. Dukwana told the paper that Magashule was set to benefit from the deal, and that Gupta had told him that the then-Free State premier was already benefiting from other business ventures with the Guptas. He claimed this all happened during a visit to the Guptas’ Saxonwold compound, where Magashule and former president Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, were present. Magashule has denied the claims, and called Dukwana’s account a “character assassination”. Dukwana challenged him to appear before the Zondo Commission to cross examine the claims.
