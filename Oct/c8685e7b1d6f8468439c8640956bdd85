The party now has other ministers set in its sights, including Bathabile Dlamini, Malusi Gigaba. [Mail & Guardian, 702] MTN has reportedly met with Nigerian authorities and the central bank to address the $8.1 billion the country says MTN owes it. While MTN has declined to comment at this stage, analysts say that it’s indicative of pressure from investors both inside Nigeria and internationally.
