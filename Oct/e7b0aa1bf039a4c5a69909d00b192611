Jacob Zuma has put his luxury home in the leafy suburb of Forest Town, up for sale, according to a report in the Sunday Times. According to the paper, the five-bedroom property, located in the northern suburbs, is on the market for R6.5 million and can be viewed by appointment only, citing estate agency Firzt Realty. Zuma’s spokesman, Vukile Mathabela, confirmed the sale to the Sunday Times, but did not say why the former president had put the house on the market, having bought it for R3.6 million in 2005. The ex-president faces mounting legal costs as he fights corruption allegations. In July, Zuma was forced to part ways with lawyer, Michael Hulley, because of costs. It was revealed last month by the presidency, that Zuma’s legal fees have cost taxpayers R16.8 million since 2006. An application, launched by the DA, to review and set aside the agreements between the presidency and Zuma‚ to cover the legal costs incurred by him for his criminal prosecution‚ will be heard in the High Court in Pretoria on November 6 and 7. Having left office in February, Zuma is entitled to full benefits, namely an annual salary of R2.87 million for life, along with a medical aid and a pension payout.
