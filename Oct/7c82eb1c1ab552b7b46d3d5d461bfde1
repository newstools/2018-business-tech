Developer Atterbury has updated the look of a new multi-billion rand precinct that will be built in the heart of Sandton. Located on 180 Katherine Street in Sandton, the Barlow Park Precinct is a mixed-use development that will be anchored by Barloworld, and will house the group’s new corporate HQ. It is being developed through a three-way partnership between Barloworld, Atterbury and African Rainbow Capital, with each group holding one-third of the landmark site. The total development is estimated to be valued at over R2.7 billion, and will cover 130,000 square metres, split between retail and leisure (10,000 sqm), dealerships (10,000s sqm), residential (55,000 sqm), and offices (55,000 sqm). When the development was first introduced at the end of 2017, it was said that it would ultimately hold over 780 residential units, a community retail centre, as well as a hotel and a gym. The build is expected to roll out in phases over an 8-year period.  Read: A look at Jewel City – a massive redevelopment project in the middle of Joburg’s CBD
