Vodacom South Africa is partnering device manufacturers to launch Enhanced Voice Services (EVS) – also known as Super High Definition (SHD) voice or HD Voice+ in a live commercial network. Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) subscribers using a compatible handset on the Vodacom network will experience improved voice clarity made possible by the EVS codec, the operator said. Siyabonga Zulu, Vodacom Group managing executive for Radio Access Network Engineering, said: “Vodacom is always looking to improve the experience customers have on our network. Deploying Enhanced Voice Services is another step in this process and will ensure even better voice quality for our 4G users. “With our extensive 4G coverage, it makes sense to ensure that 4G users get the best possible voice quality to complement our super-fast 4G speeds.” EVS can deliver speech quality that matches other audio sources such as hi-fidelity stored music and is designed to offer up to 20kHz of audio bandwidth (CD quality). In addition, EVS has been shown to provide coverage gains for cell-edge users, which will translate in better voice quality performance in cell-edge conditions, i.e. where coverage might not be optimal, Vodacom said.
