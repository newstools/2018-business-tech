The ANC in Gauteng has thrown its weight behind the scrapping of e-tolls in the province, as consumers continue to receive mixed signals over the matter. Speaking at an event in Germiston, provincial chairperson David Makhura said that e-tolls have not worked and that the ANC in Gauteng did not support the system, reports News24. “Let there be no confusion, they are not part of the future of this province. We will have to work out how to pay for the roads but not through the e-tolls”. Makhura added that the ANC in the province has made resolutions at its 13th provincial conference that e-tolls be scrapped. Makhura’s comments follow the release of the South African National Roads Agency’s (Sanral’s)  integrated report for the 2017/2018 financial year at the beginning of October. According to Sanral chairperson, Roshan Morar, it has become clear that the agency cannot continue on the growth trajectory of the previous two decades during which the size of the network expanded without commensurate funding. He noted that the last year was also a watershed, in that Sanral found it necessary for the first time to transfer an amount of R1.6 billion from the non-toll business to the toll road portfolio. “This transfer, made with the concurrence of the minister of transport, was to reduce losses incurred as a result of sustained non-payment of toll fees by users of the roads constructed under the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP),” he said. “All other toll roads managed directly by Sanral and through concessions operated smoothly – with increased use of e-tags on these routes – and were economically viable.” This means that Sanral’s 13,000 km of non-toll roads is now effectively helping pay for just 187 km of Gauteng’s e-toll roads. Finance minister Tito Mboweni this week said that e-toll were not going anywhere, and that motorists would have to pay up because nothing comes for free.
