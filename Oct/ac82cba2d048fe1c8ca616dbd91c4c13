Eat Out has announced the winners of its Mercedes-Benz Best Everyday Eateries awards for 2018. After a year-long voting period and adjudication process, the top eateries in each category were determined by public ratings received via the Eat Out app and website. The restaurants that received a large volume of high scores from fans were visited by Eat Out’s professional critics, who provided their own ratings. The final results are then based on a 50-50 composite score from the public and the critics. A number of categories were considered as part of the awards including ‘Best Bistro’, ‘Best Burger’, ‘Best Coffee Shop’ and ‘Best Steakhouse’.
