A recommendation has been made by the City of Johannesburg to rename William Nicol Drive after struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. This is according to Gauteng transport MEC, Ismail Vadi, who was speaking at the launch of the October Transport Month in Kliptown on Monday (1 October). “We have noted that the City of Johannesburg had resolved last Thursday that William Nicol Drive is renamed Winnie Madikezela-Mandela Drive and the Emfuleni council has recommended that the R82 be named in honour of Duma Nokwe,” said Vadi. He added that the recommendation will now be processed by the Gauteng and national geographic names councils for final decision-making. “The names on our road and transport infrastructure may have a technical function but government has a conscious role to play in promoting an inclusive identity with such infrastructure,” Vadi said. Following Madikizela-Mandela’s death on 2 April, a number of political parties, organisations and members of the public have called for the renaming of national landmarks in honour of her life and work. Notably, the ANC and EFF have also lobbied for the renaming of Cape Town International Airport after the politician. Alongside the renaming of William Nicol Drive, Vadi said that recommendations have been made to rename between eight and ten roads in the province including the R82, in honour of legislator Duma Nokwe. This week, Grahamstown, in the Eastern Cape, was also officially changed to Makhanda. The Airports Company South Africa‚ which is responsible for the management and administration of most national airports in the country‚ has also confirmed that Cape Town International Airport‚ East London Airport‚ Port Elizabeth International Airport and Kimberley Airport are all subject to the renaming process.
