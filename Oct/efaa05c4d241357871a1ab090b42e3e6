In September, Volkswagen announced that it would be ending worldwide production of its iconic Beetle. The manufacturer confirmed that the last VW Beetle will roll off the line from the company’s factory in the state of Puebla, Mexico, in July 2019. VW had been pulling the Beetle from select markets as part of a broader effort by the German giant to rein in its bloated product range, which spans more than 300 different vehicles and variants, including heavy trucks, motorbikes and passenger cars. Cutting back on product complexity is one of the key ways the company is trimming costs and getting leaner in the wake of its diesel emissions scandal. Volkswagen’s decision to stop producing the ‘New Beetle’ next year could sharply increase the value of the iconic original VW Beetles, according to Gumtree SA head of automotive Jeff Osborne. “The ‘New Beetle’, launched in 1998, did ok – selling 500,000 worldwide – and is very popular with some consumers but it never replaced the old version in public consciousness,” said Osborne. “Now that the upgraded Beetle is disappearing for good, I reckon the originals, which hold massive sentimental value, will see a surge in demand.” He added that there are currently well over 250 old Beetles on sale on Gumtree across the country, with good condition 1960’s models having price tags of over R40,000. “Even vehicles without engines or that are unroadworthy can fetch decent money for spare parts and we have a VW Beetle Boot Braai listed for R10,000,” he said.
