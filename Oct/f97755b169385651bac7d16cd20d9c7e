Market research firm Ask Africa announced released its Orange Index winners – focusing on the companies with the best customer service in South Africa. The winners were based on over 12,000 consumer interviews, with 167 major companies named across 29 different industries. While retailers and car manufacturers dominate the overall top 10, Ask Africa also released a list of companies with the best customer service in individual service sector. “These top 10 winners all display service excellence and are able to meet growing expectations from customers who are faced with greater choice and display diminishing loyalty,” said Sarina de Beer, director of client experience at Ask Afrika. “This year there was a strong dominance from the retail and automotive industries in the top 10 winners. “It is interesting that the telecommunications and financial services industries are no longer winning as they used to a few years ago. The top three industries in the 2018/19 Ask Afrika Orange Index in rank order were the automotive, clothing retail and food retail industries,” she said. Industry category winners These companies achieved the highest service score within their industry category. New winners are highlighted in green and the ‘super winners’ (having won the industry category for three consecutive years) are highlighted in yellow.
