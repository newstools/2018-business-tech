The Financial Times has released its latest global Executive MBA (EMBA) ranking, looking at the best 100 programmes offered globally. According to the Financial Times, EMBA graduates are more likely to work in industry and manufacturing than younger alumni from full-time MBAs and masters in management courses — and less likely to be employed in finance or consulting. To be a part of the report, the school must be accredited by either the US’s Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business or the European Equis. In addition, the EMBA must be cohort-based with at least 30 students enrolling and graduating together each year. A total of 4,680 alumni completed the survey with their responses informing five ranking criteria: salary today;
salary increase;
career progress;
work experience;
aims achieved. The joint programme offered by the Kellogg School of Management and HKUST Business School was ranked top overall for the third consecutive year. Its alumni also have the highest average salary three years after graduation at $507,000 (R7.3 million) – almost $140,000 (R2 million) greater than the second-highest earners from the Olin Business School at the University of Washington. Only one school from South Africa was featured on the list – the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) at the University of Pretoria. GIBS climbed 20 places to reach 67 in the 2018 rankings, with graduates of its modular/part-time EMBA expected to earn upwards of $200,000 (R2.9 million).
