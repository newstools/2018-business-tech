Jobs portal CareerJunction has released its latest index for September 2018, showing which jobs and skills are most in-demand across South Africa right now. According to CareerJunction, the September index settled below the 100-mark at 97 index points – indicating increased competition for jobs. “Overall, demand weakened by 6% while job search activity cooled by 2%. As we head into the final quarter of 2018, recruitment activity is expected to slow down steadily,” it said. “When doing a year-on-year comparison of job volumes across various sectors, notable decreases in labour demand, of more than 20%, are evident within the sales, medical & health and marketing sectors. “The ICT, architecture & engineering, building & construction and manufacturing sectors, on the other hand, show strengthening demand over the last quarter,” CareerJunction said. These are the three jobs that are currently trending, according to CareerJunction’s data: Architecture Average salary offerings for intermediate level positions: GP: R45,938 to R56,574 p.m. (CTC)
WC: R41,000 to R45,571 p.m. (CTC)
KZN: R38,750 to R48,333 p.m. (CTC) Business Analysis Average salary offerings for intermediate level positions: GP: R37,500 to R50,000 p.m. (CTC)

KZN: R10,000 to R15,000 p.m. (CTC) In-demand As has been the case for the past few months, South African employers are looking for software developers and middle/department managers. However, demand for financial/project accountants has been replaced by representative/sales consulting at the top of the list according to CareerJunction. “Despite the volatile demand for software developers during 2018, software development remains the most sought-after skills set on the SA job market” it said. It noted that middle/department managers also remain high in demand – particularly finance managers. “In addition, demand for sales representatives has been steadily growing over the past six months,” it said. “Since April, vacancies for sales reps have increased by 13%.”  “An overview of vacancy levels across various sectors (indicated by the Demand graph) provides a good indication of where the majority of employment takes place,” CareerJunction said. “The IT, business & management and finance sectors are undoubtedly the most sought after sectors, followed by the sales, admin, office & support and architecture & engineering sectors, among others listed. “When looking at active job seekers across various sectors (indicated by the Supply graph), areas of high supply correlate closely to areas of high demand, however supply outstrips demand in some areas, leading to a
competitive environment for job seekers. The opposite is seen for some industries.” Read: The reason you’re not hearing back after a job interview
