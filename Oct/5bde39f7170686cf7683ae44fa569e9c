MTN has launched new Entertainment Pass bundles for contract customers, which provide free data access to social media, music and video streaming. The Entertainment Pass gives customers on select price plans access to Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, YouTube, Deezer, Simfy Africa, DStv Now and ShowMax for free. MTN said that the promotion is available to contract customers who sign up for a new contract, or to those who upgrade to selected plans. The list of plans include: MTNChoice Flexi;
My MTNChoice Data;
MTN Made For Me;
MTN Made For Home;
My MTN Sky Lite;
MTN Made For Business price plans. The Entertainment Pass values are 5GB and 14GB, depending on the price plan selected, and are valid for 30 days from the time the contract or upgrade is activated. However, customers who have signed up from 1 October until 14 October will only receive their Entertainment Pass on 15 October. The Entertainment Pass is also broken down into data value per social, video or music platforms. “We want to give our customers more for less and one of the best ways to achieve this is by making it easier and more cost-effective for our customers to access the entertainment they love,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN SA. “Being unconnected is unacceptable because we all want our connections, our music and our videos to be always on, so we’ve created a way for our customers to stay connected – without worrying about data balances.” The promotion will run until the end of January 2019. Below is a breakdown of the Entertainment Pass that a customer will get, based on the price plan they’ve selected.  Read: SIM-swap fraud incidents more than double in South Africa
