Rand Merchant Investment Holding (RMI), through AlphaCode, has awarded entrepreneurial packages valued at R16 million to eight of South Africa’s most promising financial services startups. The entrepreneurial packages consist of R1 million in grant funding and R1 million in support, which includes mentorship, monthly expert-led sessions, exclusive office space in Sandton, marketing, legal and other business support services as well as access to the broader RMI network. The packages are part of the AlphaCode Incubate initiative, which is done in partnership with Merrill Lynch South Africa and Royal Bafokeng Holdings. The project identifies South African financial services entrepreneurs with extraordinary ideas and businesses that could impact the financial services industry. More than 200 startups applied to participate. Of these, sixteen made it to final pitch evening and eight recipients were selected. During the event, contestants had just three minutes to pitch their businesses, with a couple of minutes set aside for questions from a panel of judges. These are the eight winners: According to the group, the programme has disbursed R13 million in funding to 15 black-owned financial services businesses since it began three years ago. Of these, some have experienced exponential growth and gained traction locally and internationally. “The intention behind AlphaCode’s Explore, Incubate and Accelerate programmes is for RMI to discover the next OUTsurance or Discovery; we want to identify, partner and grow the future of financial services in South Africa,” said Dominique Collett, head of AlphaCode and a RMI senior investments executive.
