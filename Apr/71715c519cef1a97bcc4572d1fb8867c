32 bills need to be processed by parliament, but will go nowhere while the National Assembly takes an extended break, the City Press reports. According to the paper, the decision to take an extended holiday has caused some consternation among MPs, who say the added time off will impede their ability to do their jobs. Of 32 bills before parliament, only 10 were introduced in the last quarter of 2017 – including three which are needed to set the National Minimum Wage going. Of the remaining 22, three have been introduced, and six others are set to be introduces between July and Septembers. The rest are still with various committees. MPs are divided on the decision to take extra time off. Thos who support it say it’s so that there is balance between time spend in parliament and time spent with constituencies they represent. The DA says it’s just an excuse for the ANC to campaign for 2019 in time that should be spent working. One of the biggest disruptions will be to the National Minimum Wage which was expected to kick in from 1 May 2018. This is now expected to be delayed until a later date. MPs have warned that any bills not introduced before the end of May will unlikely be processed by parliament before 2019 – and with the year being an election year where MPs and committees might shift and change, there may be further delays, You can read the full report in the City Press for 15 April Read: National Minimum Wage waiting on parliament for rescheduled implementation date
