The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has confirmed that it will move ahead with an inquiry on BBBEE regulations in the ICT sector. In a document published on Tuesday (24 April), the regulator said that the talks would focus on ‘the review and development of the authority position of historically disadvantaged persons and broad based black economic empowerment’. The hearings are scheduled to be heard on 16 and 17 May, with major players such M-Net, Primedia, Internet Solutions, Liquid Telecoms, Vodacom, MTN and Cell C all expected to give presentations. In line with a discussion document launched in March 2017, the talks will likely focus on how Icasa should approach the implementation the ICT Sector Code in light of existing BEE ownership requirements, and how it can promote these requirements going forward. Specifically Icasa is considering raising the current BEE equity requirement above 30%, and whether changes need to be made to the current regulations to ensure that this metric is being met legitimately.
