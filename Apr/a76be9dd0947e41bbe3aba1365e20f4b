Nissan has officially launched its new Terra, a body-on-frame SUV designed and built in China to meet the growing market demand for 4×4 vehicles. It comes equipped with a versatile ladder-frame chassis, reinforced to give it greater rigidity, and features a five-link coil spring rear suspension system and rigid rear-wheel axle, a four-wheel-drive system, and hill start assist. The vehicle boasts best-in-class ground clearance, at 225 millimeters, to minimize potential damage from rough or uneven roads. In addition to its on- and off-road capabilities, the Terra also offers improved technology. “High-spec technologies have been introduced to cut engine, wind, and road noise – giving passengers a space to talk together easily. The Terra also has an upgraded and enhanced audio and navigation system, allowing users to mirror their smartphones,” it said.     Key specifications QR25 gasoline engine

Speaking to CARmag in February, Nissan South Africa said that it was working closely with its parent company to develop a vehicle that is suitable to the sub-Saharan market, however it was not in a position to confirm details at this point.
