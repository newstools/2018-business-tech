Classic cars were the best-performing asset classes over the past decade, a new report by New World Wealth shows – and South Africa’s super wealthy are getting in on the gains. New World Wealth has published its 2018 South African Wealth Report, showing exactly how the country’s richest people are investing and spending their money. The group looked specifically at investment avenues being taken in South Africa, highlighting the best and worst-performing asset classes over the last 10 years – with classic cars being the stand-out investment. Collectables like classic cars are a growing segment in the country, NWW said, as they form part of the category of luxury items that hold their value reasonably well over time. Other prominent examples of this include: art, fine wine and stamps. Collectables do not include yachts, private jets and new cars, however, as these items are unlikely to hold their value. According to NWW, the global classic car market is valued at around $5 billion, with the group’s in-house indices showing that classic car prices have risen by a strong 160% over the past 10 years (in US$ terms), making it the best-performing investment class for wealthy people globally. Wealthy car lovers in South Africa are also in on the action, often taking part in local classic car auctions in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Knysna on a regular basis, the group said.
