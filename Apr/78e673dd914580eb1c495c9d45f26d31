Airbnb has released new data on how the home sharing community has impacted tourism in South Africa. According to the data, South Africa welcomed nearly 830,000 inbound guests last year, and 551,000 outbound guests travelled from South Africa to other destinations, creating over a million connections across the world. These incoming guests also brought money with them, and the data shows that the typical South African host earned R24,633 renting out their space for an average of 17 nights. This is well below the average income earned by Cape Town’s Airbnb hosts, who earned an average of R39,348 renting out their space for an average of 27 nights a year. However it is also well above Durban’s Airbnb hosts ,which earned an average of just R1,728 renting out their space for an average of 13 nights a year. You can find the full city breakdown below.
