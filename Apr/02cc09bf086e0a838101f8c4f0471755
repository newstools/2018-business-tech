Westcon-Comstor has appointed Tidiane Lo in the capacity of director of Westcon Sub-Saharan Africa. The announcement follows a strategic realignment of the company’s African business and will provide additional leadership to help the organisation realise its goal to be the premier value-added distributor on the continent. Lo formally filled the position from 1 April 2018 and will report into Rakesh Parbhoo, CEO of Westcon-Comstor Sub-Saharan Africa. He will have oversight of the Westcon business practices that extend its Mobility, Security, Software, Unified Communications and Collaboration portfolios as well as its strategic Cloud and Services capabilities. Lo joined Westcon in 2011 at its Dakar offices, where he held the position of Regional Sales Manager for French Africa including Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. In 2015 he was promoted into the role of Sales Excellence Lead and Area Implementation Lead for Africa, based in both Dakar and Nairobi. Prior to joining Westcon he worked for the distribution company Tech/Data Azlan (from 2005 – 2011), where he had oversight of its sales operations in the French market, including the management of its strategic resellers. In his new role he will not only have oversight of the day-to-day sales, customer service, partner relationships and services operations, but will also lead the charge to unlock further potential for new and existing vendors within the Westcon solutions portfolio. This will include a particular emphasis on security, unified communications and collaboration as well as mobility, all of which he has identified as key growth areas on the continent.
