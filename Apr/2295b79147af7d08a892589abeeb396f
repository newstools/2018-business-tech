A large section of Rosebank along Oxford Road will be construction zone for the next few years, as a massive new precinct goes under development, bringing 300,000 square metres of mixed-use space to the area. Being developed by Intaprop, the Oxford Parks development officially kicked off construction in November 2017, with the first phase of the project getting underway. The completed precinct will be within walking distance of Rosebank retail, hotels medical facilities and schools and will be built within Green Star standards. The development is expected to stretch between Bompas Road and Jellicoe Road in Dunkeld, nestled between Rosebank central and Illovo. It has been proposed that 200,000 square metres be dedicated to offices and ancillary retail, and 100,000 square metres reserved for residential use. While the total development cost has not been published, it is expected to be a multi-billion rand development, with phase one reaching close to R1 billion alone. The development has been compared to similar precincts in the area, mimicking a style reminiscent of the nearby Melrose Arch – an open space ‘lifestyle’ project that brings together commercial and retail space, all around a ‘pedestrian friendly’ environment. “Commercial office space will be built to a P Grade standard to reach a minimum of a 4 Star Green Star rating. The precinct will be managed privately by the owners association,” Intaprop said. Model and Concept  The first phase will comprise three office blocks and a hotel with convenience retail and restaurants on the ground floor – with all the buildings in the phase linked by a landscaped public piazza. Phase one will cover approximately 32,000 square metres. The first phase will also include the new head office for BPSA, with a contractual complete date set for November 2018.
