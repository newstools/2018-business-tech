Statistics from the Kaspersky Security Network for the first quarter of 2018 show an overall increase in malware threats and infections in the Middle East, Turkey and Africa (META) region. Kaspersky Lab held its annual Cyber Security Weekend (11-14 April) for the Middle East, Turkey and Africa in Istanbul to explore the evolution of the threat landscape both – globally and in the region. Kenya was the most affected with 61.8% of its users infected, followed by 58.6% in Nigeria, 50.8% in Oman, and 55.6% in both Egypt and Lebanon. The statistics for the same period of time also showed a noticeable overall increase in web threats with 30.2% of users affects by malware in Saudi Arabia, 28.8% in both Egypt and Oman followed by 27.4% in the UAE. On the other hand, South Africa had the lowest number of affected users in the META region (48.8% for local and 19.6% for web threats). “We have seen an 8.5% increase in ransomware attacks in the META region in Q1 of 2018 compared to Q1 of last year, this number is not surprising, judging by the infamous success of major ransomware attacks last year. We do expect such attacks to grow and evolve in complexity and sophistication,” said Mohamad Amin Hasbini, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab.
