CareerJunction has published its latest index for the month of March, showing what jobs and skills are in high demand right now, and what salaries are being offered for those positions. According to the jobs portal, South Africa’s labour market is currently trending flat, with the March index settling just above the 100 mark, indicating minimal changes in the jobs market. Month-on-month, there were no noteworthy changes in job volumes or job search activity overall, it said.  The architecture and engineering, manufacturing and assembly, finance, and building and construction sectors have seen an uptake in jobs since January 2018. The marketing and sales sectors as well as the admin, office and support sector, on the other hand, experienced a slowing trend in hiring activity for the previous 12 months. Year-on-year, labour demand has weakened considerably in these sectors, CareerJunction said. Trending jobs include financial analysis, cost and management accounting and human resources.
