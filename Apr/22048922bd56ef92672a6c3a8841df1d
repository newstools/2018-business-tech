KIA South Africa has announced that its much-anticipated KIA Stinger will be launching in the country in August 2018. The car will be available in GT trim, powered by the high-performance 3.3-litre twin-turbocharged V6 petrol engine that develops 272 kW of power at 6,000 r/min and 510 Nm of torque between 1,300 and 4,500 r/min. Paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission that drives power to the rear wheels, Stinger is the most powerful and fastest-accelerating production KIA ever, with a 0 to 100km/h sprint time of 4.9 seconds and a top speed of 270 km/h, the company said. The Stinger was designed in Europe by Peter Schreyer, KIA’s Chief Design Officer and President, and Gregory Guillaume, Senior Chief Designer for KIA Motors Europe. The car’s chassis and drivetrain were honed at the Nürburgring Nordschleife and on some of the most dynamically challenging driving roads around the world under the direction of Albert Biermann, Executive Vice President and Head of Vehicle Test & High Performance Development. KIA South Africa said that further pricing and details would be available at the end of April.     Read: A look at Nissan’s new Fortuner competitor
