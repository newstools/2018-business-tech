Seeff has listed a five-bedroom, five-bathroom villa in Zimbali Coastal Resort on the Dolphin Coast of Kwa-Zulu Natal, for R70 million. The area is seen by developers as the hottest in the property market at present, while this home is marketed by Seeff as the “ultimate coastal property located on a beautifully elevated site with unrestricted 180 degree sea, coastal and breaker views”. “The beachfront position with sensational outlook has been considered from every living space. Consideration has been given to the prevailing wind and weather conditions to create protected courtyard entertainment spaces,” it said. The property is packaged for sale with the neighbouring vacant and separately registered site measuring 1,634 sqm of the total 4,754 sqm. This allows for the development of a second home on this site, Seeff pointed out. The Zimbali levies are calculated as R3,240 p.m. per property. The municipal rates are currently calculated on vacant land and are provided as R13,101.42 p.m. on the residence and R11,560.08 p.m. on the neighbouring site, it said. Full access is provided to all the amenities at Zimbali Coastal Resort which includes the 18 hole (par 72) Championship Zimbali Golf Course, six tennis courts, two squash courts, extensive Zimbali communal pools and direct access to the 3.5km of pristine beach.
