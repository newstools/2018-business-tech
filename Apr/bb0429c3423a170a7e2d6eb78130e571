Isuzu South Africa has announced that the first shipment of its new MU-X sports utility vehicle (SUV) has arrived at the Port Elizabeth harbour. In a statement released on Monday (23 April), Isuzu said that the vehicles will now make their way to dealer showrooms across the country, joining Isuzu’s current portfolio of one ton bakkies and commercial vehicles. The MU-X, which is already available in Australia and parts of Eastern Asia, boasts a 3.0 litre turbo diesel engine that produces 430Nm of torque, terrain command 4×4 system supported by a 5-link rear suspension, and a luxury seven-seat interior. The model will be available in 2×4 and 4×4 configurations and acts as Isuzu’s first competitor in the SUV sector for over a decade. “This is the first commercial and light commercial vehicle manufacturing operation outside of Japan in which we have acquired a 100% ownership,” said president  Isuzu Motors of Japan Masanori Katayama in March. “We are represented in 30 countries outside of Japan and successfully operate 47 manufacturing plants in these countries with joint venture partners. “Our decision with regards to South Africa demonstrates the confidence we have in this market and also is indicative of our longer-term view that South Africa will serve as an important base for our future growth on the African continent.” Official pricing details and specifications are expected shortly.
