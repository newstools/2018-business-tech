While South Africans are starting to buy cars again and the the recent repo rate cut will further encourage consumers to enter the market, the effect may be muted in the short-term due to inflationary pressures. This is according to Derick De Vries, head of VAF & Fleet Management at Standard Bank who said that higher sales in March could also be attributed to the fact that consumers and fleet operators took advantage of buying at lower costs before the VAT increase to 15% kicked in from 1 April. Increases in ad valorem tax also encouraged buyers of luxury vehicles to beat the month end deadline, he said. South Africans are no strangers to increasing car prices, and it wasn’t too longer ago that a sub-R100,000 price was a major selling point for an entry-level vehicle. However local car-buyers would do well in buying an entry-level vehicle for less than R150,000 today, with even popular models such as the Polo Vivo now heading towards the R200,000 mark. Below BusinessTech looked at seven entry-level vehicles you can still buy for less than R150,000 in South Africa.
