The National Prosecuting Authority’s Asset Forfeiture Unit has been granted a restraint order against the Gupta family for their role in the Vrede Dairy Project. The unit said that the Bloemfontein High Court granted the order, which allowed it to seize assets from the family to the tune of R250 million. These assets are tied to “individuals and entities who were implicated in the offences of theft, fraud and money laundering in respect of the Vrede Dairy Project: Estina matter,” the NPA said. It came as a result of an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the Hawks. The R250 million in seized assets will be restrained pending the outcome of a criminal trial. If there is a conviction, the AFU will apply for a confiscation order for the recovery of the claimed amount. Among the assets seized are immovable property (residential and business premises, including farms), two aircrafts, a helicopter, vehicles and bank accounts belonging to certain entities. Gupta companies affected include Oakbay Investments, Islandsite Investments, Confidents Concept, Sahara Computer, Westdawn Investments, and Aerohaven Trading.
