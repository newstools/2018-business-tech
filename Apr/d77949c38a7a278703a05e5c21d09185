The Independent Communications Authority Of South Africa (Icasa) has announced new regulations that will aim block operators from charging out-of-bundle (OOB) tariffs without subscriber consent. In a presentation held on Thursday afternoon (25 April), the regulator said that the decision was made after publishing its draft End-User and Subscriber Service Charter regulations for comment in 2017, and subsequent public consultations. The new regulations mean that operators may now no longer automatically start billing subscribers out-of-bundle tariffs when their data bundles are depleted. Instead, they must present subscribers with the option to buy a new bundle, or agree to out-of-bundle billing – alongside usage depletion notifications (SMSs) as customers consume their data bundles. Icasa also proposed that users’ mobile data must roll over if they do not deplete their bundles, and that consumers can transfer data to other subscribers on the same network. A number of mobile companies, including both MTN and Vodacom, announced  at the end of 2017 that they would slash their OOB prices in line with the new regulations.
