FNB has announced that it will be redesigning its branches, and has unveiled the new look at its Rivonia branch, north of Johannesburg this week The bank said the new design is based on extensive research among customers, and is expected to enhance customer experience by balancing the use of technology with a personalised service. “Digital banking is quite central to how we enable our customers but we are cognisant of the fact that some customers prefer face to face interaction,” said Lee-Anne van Zyl, CEO of FNB Points of Presence. “This new design essentially simplifies the banking experience by channelling customers that prefer to bank digitally to the ‘Help yourself’ zone where customers can transact via the app, online banking and cell phone banking. On site will also be designated staff assigned to assist customers transact in the digital zone,” van Zyl said. FNB said that while the new design embraces digital banking because of its convenience and cost effectiveness, customers will still receive personalised service from specialist bankers who will be able to assist in resolving complex queries. FNB also has a queue management system that allows customers to book a priority queue ticket in off peak times to minimise time spent in the branch. Customers can also receive updates via SMS about the estimated queuing time so they are aware of the amount of time they may spend in the branch. “Going forward, FNB will adopt this new design across other branches where a need is identified, because it’s aligned to giving customers the choice to either bank digitally or over the counter,” said van Zyl. Other features of the new branch include statement printing at Self Service devices, a more comfortable and confidential teller environment and private meeting rooms should customers wish to have a private discussion with a financial planner or a relationship manager.
