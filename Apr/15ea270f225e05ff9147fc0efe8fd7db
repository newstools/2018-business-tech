Vodacom Group has announced that it has appointed William Mzimba as chief officer for Vodacom Business with effect from 1 May 2018. Mzimba will be responsible for Vodacom’s enterprise units in Africa and will lead a team tasked with driving digital transformation in targeted industries and markets. He will report directly to Group CEO Shameel Joosub, and will serve on both the group executive committee and the board of Vodacom SA. The exec joins Vodacom from Accenture where he held the position of chief executive and chairman of Accenture in Africa since 2006. During this 18-year tenure, he oversaw the growth and strategy of Accenture in Africa, advised clients on their business strategies and helped transform their businesses through technology platforms. More recently he also served as their financial services industry lead, responsible for banking and insurance business, the group said. Mzimba will be filling the role vacated by Vuyani Jarana in October last year, when he left to join as CEO of SAA, to head the struggling airline’s turnaround strategy. He holds an MBA, BA (Honours) in Business Studies, Management Advancement Programme (MAP) and Diploma in Datametrics and has a proven track record in leveraging technology as a business enabler to drive results, as well as implementing successful strategies in growing businesses.
