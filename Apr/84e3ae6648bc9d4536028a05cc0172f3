Despite no longer being president of the country, Jacob Zuma is still casting a large shadow over the ANC, with his supporters mobilising ahead of his appearance in court on corruption charges. According to the City Press, Zuma’s supporters are angry with the ANC’s decision to effectively abandon Zuma, after it ordered members to steer clear of supporting his trial in any capacity that links them to the party. However, the paper reports seeing t-shirts with Zuma’s face on it along with the ANC logo, which his supporters are expected to wear to court in defiance of this order. Zuma is expected to appear in court on several charges of fraud and corruption on 6 April 2018. In a statement this past week, following the publishing of the ANC’s policy document from its 54th conference, the party said that it was trying to distance itself from members who are facing criminal charges. Without mentioning Zuma specifically, the ANC said that the party cannot be seen to be defending those who are linked to state capture or any criminal activity, and called on members to rather defend these people in their personal capacities. The former president still has a lot of support within the party, including the Women’s League and among his former allies. Zuma says he is a victim of a conspiracy against him. “People are free, but I am not. They are still after me. Even after I have left, they are still after me,” he said this week.
