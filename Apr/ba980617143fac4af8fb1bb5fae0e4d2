Non-profit member organisation, Consumer Reports, has released its latest report on the best smartphone to own in 2018. Unsurprisingly Apple and Samsung dominated the list, with Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and S9+ smartphones jointly ranked first despite representing only a modest leap forward for the manufacturer’s lineup, Consumer Reports said. Tests included placing the phones in a tumbler to simulate the effects of repeatedly being dropped, while other factors such as load times, battery usage, camera and audio quality were also considered to give a total score out of 100. “The new phones offer stepped-up security features, super slow-motion video, and a camera that can turn your image into a personalized emoji, Consumer Reports said. “In the end, though, it was durability, speedier processing, and top-quality sound that nudged the S9 and S9+ just ahead of the competition in an exceptionally crowded field. Just six points separate our top 20 smartphones.” However, the list also proves that smartphones are in a good place right now with very little separating the top 10. “It really comes down to personal preference when you’re talking about high-end phones these days,” the group said. Apple’s iPhone X was placed eighth with 78 points while the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8 took sixth and seventh places respectively with 79 points each. In contrast, the top five was comprised entirely of Samsung products, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 ranked third with 80 overall points, followed by Samsung S8 Active (79 points) and Galaxy S8 Plus (79).
