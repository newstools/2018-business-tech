Vendor-neutral colocation data centre, Teraco, says it has passed 12,000 interconnects and is growing at a rate of 500 interconnects per quarter. Teraco CEO, Lex van Wyk, said that the company is home to Africa’s largest peering exchange, NAPAfrica and is playing a critical role in the development of an interconnect hub. Located in the Teraco’s data centres in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg, NAPAfrica facilitates the exchange of around 300GBps of traffic between more than 300 African and international peers. “NAPAfrica’s peers cover the full spectrum of the Internet including: content, cloud, carriers and networks, ISPs, CDNs, but also many enterprises, who are rapidly realising the benefits of peering,” he said. “Not too long ago most content was acquired from Europe via expensive data connections, Teraco has changed this and as a result, most large international content providers now colocate within Teraco’s data centres, resulting in a much better user experience and lower costs,” the chief executive said. Teraco has also announced that it is currently in a POC (proof of concept) phase with select clients to further enhance its Interconnection Platform, which will enable clients to virtually cross connect with one another and their partners of choice via a single physical cable, further lowering costs.
