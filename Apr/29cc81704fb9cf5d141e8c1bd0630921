The Cape Innovation and Technology Initiative (CiTi) has announced a significant scale up of its CapaCiTi technology skills and job readiness programmes. The group says it has unlocked R250 million to support technology skills and job creation in South Africa. Over the next three years, CapaCiTi will equip in excess of 3,000 young individuals with industry-demanded technology and business skills, placing them in permanent jobs in South Africa’s leading companies. This is in addition to the 1000 candidates already trained, mentored and placed. This large-scale expansion has been enabled through the generous support from South African corporate businesses, in particular R100 million from BCX, and also R75 million from the National Treasury Jobs Fund. CapaCiTi is now training young, unemployed South Africans in Johannesburg, Durban and Port Elizabeth as well as at the organisation’s hub in Cape Town. Through CapaCiTi programmes, unemployed previously disadvantaged young individuals (40% female) are equipped with a relevant and work-ready skill set which they go on to apply in their internship and permanent placement in one of CapaCiTi’s partners. CapaCiTi has achieved a 97% placement rate in 130 South African companies to date, allowing them to significantly grow, diversify and retain their young tech talent.
