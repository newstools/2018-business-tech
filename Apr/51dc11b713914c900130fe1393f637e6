South Africa’s universities make headlines for various reasons – be it student protests or ranking among the world’s best for a host of different subjects – but many people do not even have an inkling to where these institutes are situated, or how they look. South Africa is home to 26 universities, split into three different groups: There are 9 universities of technology focused on vocationally oriented education;
6 comprehensive universities offering a combination of academic and vocational diplomas and degrees; and
11 traditional universities offering theoretically oriented university degrees. The newest learning institution, Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, located north of Pretoria, was unveiled in April 2015, adding to the two universities launched in 2014, namely Sol Plaatje University, in the Northern Cape, and the University of Mpumalanga.
