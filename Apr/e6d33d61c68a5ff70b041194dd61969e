Volkswagen South Africa has announced the launch of its new Tiguan Allspace – aimed at closing the the gap between the compact Tiguan and the premium class Touareg. Volkswagen said that the vehicle’s 215 mm additional external length creates capacity for a standard third row of seats, which turns the longer wheelbase Tiguan into a 7-seater. It will also feature a increased boot space of 115 litres, while a new 132kW TSI engine is being added to the range for the first time. “However the Allspace doesn’t just stand out through its longer wheelbase,” said Volkswagen. “It also sets itself apart from the more compact Tiguan through design modifications in the front and an expanded range of standard equipment.” Trim lines The Allspace is available in three trim lines – Trendline, Comfortline and Highline. However, all of them include expanded standard features; highlighting its positioning between the NWB Tiguan and the flagship Touareg.
