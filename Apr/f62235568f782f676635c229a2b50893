JSE-listed private education provider, ADvTECH has continued its expansion into Kenya and Uganda, with new acquisitions adding 9 schools, 5 campuses, boarding facilities and approximately 4,100 students to its portfolio. The expansion follows the establishment of a new partnership with Scholé Ltd, which has managed various schools throughout Sub-Saharan Africa since 2012. The partnership is part of a strategy to acquire schools across the continent and build a network of institutions known for their academic excellence in the mid-fee segment. ADvTECH holds a majority stake, with the remaining shareholding held by the original founders of Schole International and Caerus Capital, a leading international education consultancy group. In Kenya, ADvTECH is acquiring, subject to the fulfilment of conditions, the prestigious Makini group of schools. Makini is well-known for academic excellence in the region, has 8 schools on 4 campuses in Nairobi and Kisumu and caters to 3,200 students from kindergarten to Grade 12. In Uganda, the partners will continue to manage Kisubi High School, a co-ed mid-fee boarding school in Kampala, which provides a child-centred learning experience for its more than 900 students. Scholé has managed the school since 2015. Read: Education group ADvTECH comes clean on fraud
