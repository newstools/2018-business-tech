A number of Jacob Zuma’s followers in KZN are reportedly planning a campaign to oust president Cyril Ramaphosa. According to a report by the Sunday Times, the loyalists will continue voting for the ANC within the province, but plan to give their national ballots to a party sympathetic to their cause should their plan to remove Ramaphosa fail. The report states that the Zuma backers were considering working with Andile Mngxitama’s Black First Land First ahead of the polls, while a close friend of Zuma’s, Caesar Nongqunga, has already formed a new political party with Zuma’s blessing – the African Transformation Congress. ANC national working committee member and former KwaZulu-Natal chairman Senzo Mchunu said the party was aware of the plan, however other members maintained that the story was just ‘lies and rumours’. You can read the full report in the Sunday times for 8 April 2018. Legal battle Zuma made an appearance on corruption charges in the Durban High Court on Friday (6 April), in what is expected to be the first move in a long-drawn-out legal battle. With the matter having been postponed to 8 June, talks have already moved to how Zuma plans to fund the battle as he will no longer have the endless resources of the state to fund a ‘Stalingrad strategy’. As the corruption case is also expected to hold Zuma’s personal financial records under close scrutiny, Zuma could potentially lose any assets that are considered to be “proceeds of crime” – including his Nkandla home. Zuma’s legal team is now expected to seek a review of national director of public prosecutions Shaun Abrahams’s decision that there was no reason for him not to be tried.
