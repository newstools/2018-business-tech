Penthouse living in Cape Town ranks up there with any apartment in some of the world’s most attractive cities. Penthouses by definition tend to be very exclusive as there is a limited supply and usually only a handful on the market, says Ian Slot, MD for Seeff Atlantic Seaboard, Waterfront and City Bowl. These apartments offer the best views, especially along Cape Town’s Atlantic Seaboard and come with a significant status factor. Floor spaces can range from around 600sqm-1000sqm for a top class unit, but it is really the views, exclusivity, privacy and convenient lock-up-and-go lifestyle that draws buyers, said Slot. Most tend to have direct lift access, open-plan living with fabulous finishes, large glass windows for maximum vistas throughout, balconies or rooftop entertainment areas and some come with a private pool. Monaco is home to the world’s most expensive penthouse, the 3300sqm The Tour Odéon which five floors atop the tallest building in the principality. At $387 million, it comes with sweeping views of the Mediterranean and an enormous outdoor swimming area. Second on the list, is One Hyde Park in London at $227 million which comes complete with a golf simulator, private cinema and squash court. Third and fourth place is occupied by New York penthouses. The Pierre Hotel Penthouse at $125 million is set over three floors, offers panoramic views over Manhattan and boasts a living room considered to be ‘the finest privately owned room in the world’, a Swedish sauna and an 18-century style library. The CitySpire Penthouse in New York is priced at $100 million. It is also set over three floors and comes with 6 bedrooms, 9 bathrooms, a media room, conference room, formal gallery, a 1,000-bottle wine cellar, a large outdoor area and a separate apartment just for the staff. In the Southern Hemisphere, the most expensive is believed to be Australia’s Sydney Harbourfront penthouse at $30 million (about R357 million) which offers 700sqm and sweeping views the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House. South African prices are still well below international rates, said Slot. The most exclusive penthouses tend to be in Clifton and at the V&A Waterfront Marina where you could now expect to pay up to R200,000/sqm and R130,000/sqm respectively for a an exclusive position. The One Penthouse at the One&Only at the Waterfront which sold (by Seeff) in late 2009 for over R110 million is still regarded as the most expensive penthouse in the country. Lynn Pinn and Finella Botes, Seeff agents for the Waterfront and Mouille Point say that the Front Yacht Basin Penthouses at the V&A Marina rank among the most sought-after with prices of around R40 million-R69 million. The marina comes with top security and residents have access to gymnasiums and swimming pools and can also rent yacht berths in the neighbouring Silo Precinct where a penthouse in Silo 3 sold late last year for R84 million to a local businessman. The most exclusive penthouse currently on the market is however, on the beachfront in Mouille Point in the new East West building. Priced at R88 million plus VAT (R130,177/sqm), it offers 676sqm spread over two floors and comes with three bedroom suites, two living areas and an entertainment deck and private pool.        Adrian Mauerberger and Cecily Sher, luxury sectional title agents for Seeff Atlantic Seaboard add that in the Sea Point and Fresnaye areas, complexes such as La Camargue and The Fresnaye offer highly desired penthouses. Prices range from R22.5 million at The Fresnaye (465sqm, R48,400/sqm) to R42 million at La Camargue in Sea Point.  The Cape Town CBD also offer a number of top class penthouses with fabulous city and harbour views according to Seeff CBD agents, JP Ricketts, Warren Emett and Alan Screen. Prices range from around R17.5 million-R30 million (around R80,000-R98,865/sqm). The 5-star Pepper Club penthouse offers panoramic views and duplex living with three bedroom suites, priced at R17.5 million (R80,275/sqm) while the two Stonehill Place Penthouses which sit atop the Radisson Blu hotel are priced at R20 million and R25.5 million respectively. These penthouses all have access to the fabulous hotel amenities including restaurants, a spa and gymnasium and a swimming pool.   According to Seeff Sandton, the most expensive penthouses in Sandton, Johannesburg include the Michelangelo Towers which sold for R43 million in 2014 and was marketed at R50 million about 18-months ago. Also, the Regent in Morningside which sold for R31 million in 2016 and was again listed about 18-months ago at R60 million. The Leonardo, currently under construction in Maude Street, Sandton will reportedly offer a three-storey penthouse known as the ‘Leonardo Suite’ which is expected to have a price tag of up to R180 million.
