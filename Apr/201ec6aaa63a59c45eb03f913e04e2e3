In the last quarter of 2017, CareerJunction published its salary review, which provides insight into salary variations between the major cities. The group’s data generally lines up with Smith Garb’s, particularly in specific categories, like CAs, bookkeepers and cost accounting. The table below extrapolates CareerJunction’s data, expressing as an average annual salary, taking into account the entire range of experience (starting to senior). According to CareerJunction, in the finance category salaries in Gauteng are 6.5% higher than the national average, while salaries in the Western Cape are significantly lower (as much as22% lower), while KwaZulu-Natal’s salaries are 5% lower. The data below is particularly pertinent when measuring salaries between Gauteng and the Western Cape as the latter is sugbject to quite a lot of ‘semigration’, and has also attracted a number of fintech related start-ups in recent years.
