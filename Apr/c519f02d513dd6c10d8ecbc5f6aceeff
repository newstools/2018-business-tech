Recruitment start-up Giraffe has announced that it has closed a second round of equity funding, led by Edge Growth’s Vumela Fund with participation from Omidyar Network, the Brozin family’s Forever Young Capital and Catapult Trust. Giraffe uses mobile technology and matching algorithms to enable businesses to recruit high volumes of quality, medium-skilled staff faster and more affordably than any other recruitment method, and gives medium-skilled jobseekers more access to opportunities at no cost. Since launching in 2015, Giraffe said it has attracted over half a million jobseekers and invited over 150,000 candidates for interviews. The second funding round comes two years after Giraffe raised seed investment from Omidyar Network, the Silicon Valley venture fund established by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Giraffe CEO Anish Shivdasani said: “We realise that since we excel at delivering large volumes of quality candidates to businesses whenever they need them, we can simultaneously give jobseekers more access to opportunities. “Over the past two years we have made significant progress evolving our product, growing our user base and driving revenues. We feel we have reached the stage to take on additional capital to accelerate our growth, and we’re excited to bring a truly amazing group of investors on board.” Read: 6 hot South African tech start-ups to watch in 2018
