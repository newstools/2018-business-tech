Capitec has been one of the biggest growth and success stories in the South African banking sector – and chief executive Gerrie Fourie’s salary reflects this. In its most recent results, the bank reported an 18% rise in headline earnings to R4.5 billion for the year ended February 2018, while generating a return of 27% on its shareholders’ equity. Diluted headline earnings per share increased 18% to R38.46, while the directors declared a final gross dividend of 945 cents per ordinary share, bringing the total dividends for the year to R14.70 per share. Net transaction fee income (non-lending) increased from R3.9 billion to R5.1 billion in 2018, and now makes up 41% of total net income, due to an increase in transaction volumes. Income from operations climbed 13% to R17.8 billion, while operating costs increased by 17% to R6.4 billion. Notably, the group’s active clients rose 15% to 9.868 million, from 8.569 million before, while the group opened 30 new branches over the period, to 826. Group CEO Gerrie Fourie received a R56.6 million payout, thanks mainly due to a long-term incentive (LTI), along with a 10% increase in his basic pay package. According to Capitec, the group’s year-on-year growth in HEPS of 18% was above the 15% target, which translated to a short-term incentive (STI) payment of 36.7% of the approved total guaranteed packaged (TGP) for the 2018 financial year. For the LTI, the number was a split between the share options taken and the stock appreciation rights (SARs) vesting in the financial year. Fourie’s salary was made up of a R10.75 million guaranteed package, R240,000 in other benefits, a R4.05 million short-term bonus, and a long-term incentive payout of R41.6 million. Capitec CFO, Andre du Plessis was also rewarded for the group’s performance, with his complete remuneration package for the year amounting to R41.6 million – also thanks to a R30.2 million LTI payout. In comparison, Nedbank CEO Mike Brown took home a R38 million for the full year, while Absa CEO Maria Ramos received a R37 million salary. Standard Bank CEO Sim Tshabalala earned R48.5 million.
