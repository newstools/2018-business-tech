Ride hailing service, Taxify in partnership with emergency assistance app Namola, have announced the launch of an in-app safety button that connects at risk drivers to emergency services. The emergency button aims to address concerns around driver safety and security. The integration is currently in its pilot phase, with plans to roll out to all drivers by the end of April. “Rider and driver safety is our first and foremost priority. The safety button will allow Taxify drivers to access rapid deployment of the correct emergency response, should they find themselves in danger,” country manager for Taxify, Gareth Taylor said. “Namola are the leaders in community safety, we have a huge sense of relief in rolling out this partnership.” Supported by Dialdirect Insurance, Namola, is a mobile app that helps users receive emergency assistance at the push of a button when they need it most. The app allows users to share their GPS coordinates, name and nature of the emergency with a 24/7 response call centre, which can verify incident details and connect to emergency medical services and SAPS. The partnership will enable Taxify drivers to access the Namola functionality from within the Taxify app. Launched in South Africa in 2016, Taxify is available in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth.
