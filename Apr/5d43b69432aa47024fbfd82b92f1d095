JPMorgan in collaboration with Witsâ€™ Tshimologong Precinct has launched Africa Rising 4.0, an incubation programme aimed at early stage startup growth in Johannesburg. In a statement released on Tuesday (10 April), the company said that the 12-week intensive incubation programme is designed to coach the disciplines of entrepreneurship, while also building innovative digital businesses. 15 startups will be selected for the incubator programme and will receive advice from established entrepreneurs. The curriculum will be custom-designed to suit the various business entities participating in the programme. Masterclasses will be themed on topical and relevant issues facing the startups addressing trending digital technologies such as blockchain, digital marketing and women in technology. In addition, there will be hands-on support from experts dedicated to helping founders and early stage entrepreneurs. Those interested in participating need a valid proof of concept (POC) with a mock-up or video presentation. The POC also needs to provide evidence that it can create value for customers and is a product or service that is in demand. One way to show this is through having an existing digital marketing footprint and online presence. Applicants need to be older than 35 with a BEE profile and come from a low-income household. It must be evident that the idea requires digital development that focuses on hardware, software, content, including games, apps or animation. Applications for Africa Rising 4.0 officially opened on 9 April 2018. Read: SA e-health app Vula Mobile picks up R1 million in funding
