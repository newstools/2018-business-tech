Legal firm Webber Wentzel has announced a selection of 10 start-up businesses that will join its Ignite legal incubation programme. Launched at the end of 2017, successful applicants receive tailored legal services, together with mentoring and training support, as well as targeted networking and profile-raising opportunities from the law firm. According to Webber Wentzel, the 10 are all highly innovative businesses who are disrupting their respective industries, while preference was given to high-potential South African ventures that already have some market traction. “We’re hoping to form a long-term relationship of trust with the management team who see the potential and value in partnering with us to ensure their future success. We’d like to prevent avoidable mistakes, said Aalia Manie, senior associate for Webber Wentzel. “It will be important for management to spend some time with us so that we can do a deep dive into their business. We will try our best to be flexible regarding when, where and how long we spend with them in each case – we understand that entrepreneurs are busy people.” You can find the complete list of companies detailed below.
