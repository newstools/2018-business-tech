HMD Global has announced that the Nokia 1 smartphone is now available to purchase in South Africa. In a statement released by the group on Wednesday (11 April), HMD Global said that the phone will run on Android Oreo (Go edition), and  features a quad-core processor, front and rear cameras, 4G connectivity and dual SIM capability. It will be available in Warm Red and Dark Blue, and buyers can also change the style of their phone using the Xpress-on covers which come in a range of vibrant colours. “With fewer pre-installed and much lighter apps on Android Oreo (Go edition), you get two more available storage out of the box compared with Android Nougat,” HMD Global said. “All Nokia smartphones come with no bloatware, skins, UI changes or unnecessary apps pre-loaded onto your phone, giving you a pure Android experience.” The Nokia 1 smartphone will be available to purchase from Cell C, MTN and Vodacom and other leading retail stores from R999.
