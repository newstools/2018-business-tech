Vodacom says that it has hit 80% 4G coverage in South Africa – claiming to be the first network in Africa to attain such a high population coverage on its network. According to the group, current local 4G coverage is at 80.12%, while 99.78% of the population is covered by 3G, and 99.97% covered by 2G. The network attributed the high coverage rate to its ‘accelerated rural coverage programme’, which was outlined by Vodacom in June last year. Some of the rural areas which now have access to 4G coverage, include Sterkfontein in Limpopo, Brandfort in the Free State and Sundays River Valley in the Eastern Cape, among others, Vodacom said. “Ulundi in KwaZulu Natal now enjoys the same 4G signal as Vodacom subscribers who live in the heart of Johannesburg,” it said. Vodacom has invested R39.7 billion in its network in South Africa over the past five years, despite ongoing spectrum constraints. “Our aim is to expand our network coverage to all parts of the country, including remote rural areas. Access to new, sub 1GHz spectrum will enable the more cost effective rollout of 4G, which will help Vodacom increase broadband coverage to more South Africans,” said Vodacom CTO, Andries Delport.
