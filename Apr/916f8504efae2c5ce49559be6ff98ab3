IMB Financial Services has launched of the Money App, which will enable anyone in South Africa to access and manage their finances from the convenience of a smartphone or tablet. After successful beta testing the IMB Money App was officially launched on March 30, 2018 across both iOS and Android operating systems. The Money App is available for free from the Google Play and Apple app stores, and at less than 10 mb in total size won’t incur large data fees to download. Once the IMB Money App is loaded onto a smartphone, customers can safely and conveniently check balances, access funds, manage their bills, and transfer money locally or outside of South Africa via their mobile devices. Director of IMB, Glen Jordan, said: “IMB is not a debt counselling company or a traditional bank, but rather a fintech company that embraces technology and a client-centric business model to empower those who are either excluded from the banking system or those who are struggling with debt. “We designed this App from the ground up to be secure, light on data requirements, and to offer personal financial control to the millions living in South Africans who may not qualify for a traditional banking account.” Once the IMB App is linked to an IMB MasterCard customers can withdraw cash from any ATM, pay bills directly, or purchase airtime, data and electricity from their phone or tablet any time of day, said Jordan. IMB said it is training entrepreneurial partners to set up IMB Service Centres in their own communities to help customers load the app on their phones and assist with financial planning. “Currently we have 23 IMB Service Centre franchises servicing communities throughout South Africa with more coming on board every month,” said Jordan.
