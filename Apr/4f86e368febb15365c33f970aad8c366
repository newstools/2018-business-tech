With petrol prices threatening to reach an all-time high in South Africa, South African motorists may now seriously consider moving to a diesel vehicle. According to April’s official fuel prices, diesel motorists can save up to a R1.70 a litre compared to petrol motorists, while recent low-cost entries from manufacturers such as Ford and Renault mean that diesel cars are also not as expensive as they once were. However, there is still one major cost to consider. According to data published by the Automobile Association (AA) in March, recent studies show up to 38,000 people die prematurely as a result of diesel engines exceeding their stated emissions standards. Despite this, 37% of respondents said that they still prefer diesel over petrol. In addition, 56% of total respondents said that they prefer diesel over petrol engines – showing that the benefits of driving a diesel engine still greatly outweighs the negatives for the majority of local motorists.
