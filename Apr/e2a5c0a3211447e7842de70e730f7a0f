Nedbank has published its integrated financial report for 2017, showing how much its executives got paid last year – including a R38 million payday for CEO Mike Brown. According to the report, Nedbank paid a total of R173 million to its executive team and the board of directors in 2017. Brown earned a basic salary of R8.1 million, and scored bonuses worth R13.75 million. The rest of his pay package was made up of vested shares as part of his long-term (LTI) incentives and dividends paid, bringing the total to R38.124 million. The CEO was also awarded a R14.5 million worth of shares for the year, as part of his LTI. Managing Executive for Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking, Brian Kennedy, was the second highest earner on the group’s books, taking home R36.25 million for the year, followed by group COO, Mfundo Nkhulu who earned R25.7 million. CFO, Raisibe Morathi took home R21.8 million, ME of Nedbank Retail and Business Banking, Ciko Thomas earned R18 million, and Nedbank Wealth’s Iolanda Ruggerio pocketed R12.9 million. Brown’s and a few other executives’ salaries were down from 2016, despite the bank providing a solid performance for the year. In March, the bank reported that headline earnings, including losses in associate income of R744 million from its associate bank Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), increased 2.8% to R11.8 billion. This translated into an increase in diluted headline earnings per share (DHEPS) of 2.4% to R24.06 and an increase in HEPS of 2.2% to R24.52. Despite the growth, Brown’s salary was 2.3% down from the R39 million he earned in 2016, while Nkhulu’s, Morathi’s and Ruggiero’s salaries were also lower.
