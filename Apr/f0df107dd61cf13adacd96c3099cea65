Vula Mobile, an app that makes it easy to refer patients to specialists, has picked up R1 million in funding from HAVAÍC, an investment and advisory firm that specialises in early-stage businesses in Africa. Vula connects health workers in remote and under-served areas to medical and surgical specialists in urban centres. The app has been recognised locally, winning MTN’s Most Innovative App Award, as well as internationally as a top 20 finalist in Amazon’s City on a Cloud Awards. Dr Lungi Nyathi, currently the non-executive chair of Vula, and an executive director at Medscheme, said: “Government health departments globally face budget constraints, and we feel it more strongly here in Sub-Saharan African. “The primary goal of Vula will remain the provision of efficient specialist healthcare access to South Africa’s rural population, and potentially those of other countries.” The funds from the capital raise enabled the Vula team to work full time.
