Nissan has had its best twelve months of sales in South Africa since the year 2000, the group said in a statement on Wednesday (25 April). The Japanese manufacturer hit 10% market share in fiscal year 2017, with passenger vehicle sales growing by 44% versus the previous year. In bakkies Nissan said it took a share of 19.5%, up by nearly a fifth. Datsun sales rose to 1.3%, the brand’s highest market share in South Africa since 1981. In Sub-Saharan Africa sales also grew, rising to 13.9%. The sales success came on the back of product launches including the Patrol, X-Trail and Micra Active. “Nissan is now poised to build on our success with further growth in Africa,” said Mike Whitfield, MD of Nissan South Africa. “We have invested almost R1 billion rand to increase the efficiency of our plant at Rosslyn increasing automation without reducing jobs, and in training and skills development for our people.” To drive future growth Nissan said it will focus on further developing its dealership network in South Africa with an improved customer experience and enhanced facilities. The company will continue to work to increase its share of the passenger vehicle market, while maintaining its strong position in bakkies, it said. Nissan was the first manufacturer to introduce an electric vehicle to South Africa, with the Nissan LEAF launched locally in 2013. Globally more than 300,000 units of the LEAF have been sold, more than any other electric vehicle. Read: A look at Nissan’s new Fortuner competitor
