The issue of visas has continued to dominate local news over the past few weeks, with Australian home affairs minister Peter Dutton stating that he is now actively considering “several” applications from South African farmers for refugee or humanitarian status in Australia. The country also recently announced a new visa scheme aimed at attracting highly skilled migrants from countries such as South Africa, in a bid to help grow Australian businesses. However, Australia is not the only country that is looking overseas to boost its workforce, with the UK also looking to boost foreign employment due to a high employment rate and an exodus of workers following the announcement on Brexit.
