Gauteng premier David Makhura has moved to allay motorists’ fears over reports that the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act (Aarto) Amendment Bill will see them losing their drivers licences over e-toll fines. BusinessTech reported on Wednesday that those attending the latest round of public hearings surrounding the proposed Aarto Act and its amendments, heard that ignoring e-toll gantries could constitute a demerit on their licence – and could ultimately lead to suspension. Premier Makhura however, said that the Aarto Act was drafted long before what he calls “the new dawn”, and that he met with president Cyril Ramaphosa last week (Wednesday, 28 March 2018) to discuss e-tolls, and to find solutions for the failed system. “The president has put in place a process that will deal with the issue of e-tolls and I am confident that we will find a solution that will satisfy all of us. “The process has started and the President himself is going to lead it. The Amendment Bill processes that are current underway started a long time ago…long before the new dawn,” said Makhura. Amendment Bill process started in 2013, with the AARTO Amendment Bill 2013 and was passed at the National Assembly in September 2017. Makhura urged residents not to panic and encouraged them to make their inputs during the ongoing public hearings regarding the Aarto Amendment Bill. The premier reiterated that e-tolls have not worked. Read: E-tolls have failed: ANC
