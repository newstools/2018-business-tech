FNB this week launched a new functionality on its banking app that enables customers to securely list and sell their homes privately to buyers who most likely qualify for a home loan – while claiming a cost saving associated with the process. “With over 8 million properties registered in the deeds office, we see a significant opportunity to become a game-changer in the property industry. The bank continues to innovate by delivering customer-centric integrated financial services underpinned by digitisation. “Substantial investment has been made to ensure that our digital platforms are not only helpful but also built to enhance the overall customer experience; ultimately helping consumers to help themselves,” said Raj Makanjee, FNB Retail CEO. Nav chief imagineer (CEO), Jolandé Duvenage, said: “Through this solution, our sellers and buyers can engage, arrange to view a listed property and negotiate the price, via Secure Chat on the FNB Banking App. Sellers and buyers and sellers also can disclose personal contact information only when they are comfortable to do so.” FNB’s Nav Home service helps customers to search for houses, get pre-selected for finance and uncover associated costs with calculators. To date, Nav Home has over 1 million unique visitors and has paid out R4.7 billion worth of home loans since inception,” FNB said. Nav Home carries 300,000 properties including distressed homes under sale, along with development properties which FNB said can include a big discount. According to FNB, 15% is incurred usually for a R1 million property, but by using the app, you can save around 5% of that, including agent costs. FNB provides a free home value – with estimates, along with similar current listing in your area to price. Read: FNB launches new Nav Money tool
