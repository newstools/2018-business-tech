The Department of Labour recently released its job opportunities and employment report. The report was based on more than 48,309 online and newspaper job vacancy advertisements over the course of the 2017/18 financial year. Out of the job vacancies advertised, the following vacancies were in high demand: Sales and marketing managers;
Software developers;
Shop sales assistants;
Retail and wholesale trade managers. “While the shape of the industry will always be changing, the overall occupations in demand and requirements remain the same, as technology-driven approaches continue to gain interest with most of the organisations,” the report said. “The trend confirms the main economic industries, e.g., community, finance and trade industries that have probably sustained employment creation under the reporting period. “The impact of this trend is that the slow economic growth observed in the performance of the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) cannot be sustainable in line with the expansion of the labour force in the country over time. “In other words, the job opportunities are limited and not sufficient to absorb a large number of new entrants in the labour market, in particular, those who have not worked in the past five years.” (Click to enlarge image).
