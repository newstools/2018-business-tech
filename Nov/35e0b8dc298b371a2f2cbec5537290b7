Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: The state capture commission has heard more testimony on how former president Jacob Zuma was at the centre of the scandal – pushing through all sorts of decisions in government and the ANC itself due to his control over the party’s NEC, and interfering with placements at the national prosecuting office. [IOL, eNCA] Health minister Aaron Motsoaledi has hit back at those saying that the country’s NHI plan is being rubber-stamped and hastily pushed through. He said that the scheme has been in development for over a decade, and is being handled with care. Opposition parties have highlighted breaches in due process, while medical groups have called for government to deal with existing healthcare crises before adding another one.

The prosecution office has had to let the current case go as its investigations are not yet complete, but said that it will launch another case as soon as it can. [EWN] Transnet is taking legal action against its former CEO, the disgraced Brian Molefe, and other executives who the group says owes it R80 million – plus interest.
