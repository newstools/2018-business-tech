Telkom says it has become South Africa’s first mobile operator to enable data transfer and the rollover of unused data. This, it said, is in compliance with the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) End-User Subscriber Service Charter (EUSSC). Customers on all plans can now transfer their data between Telkom mobile customers and enjoy extended data validity periods. “Telkom becomes the first mobile operator to do,” it said. Andrew Dawson, Telkom executive for mobile products and services said they proceeded with the implementation of the end user subscriber charter, despite regulatory uncertainty. “Telkom has always led the charge on data,” said Dawson. “We championed lower data prices for consumers and the implementation of the customer services charter is yet another way of protecting the customer’s interest.” In its implementation of the customer services charter, Telkom said that there will be a greater benefit for customers who buy smaller bundles (from 25MB – 500MB). These customers will now have up to six months to use their data purchases. Read: Telkom nears 400,000 homes passed with fibre
