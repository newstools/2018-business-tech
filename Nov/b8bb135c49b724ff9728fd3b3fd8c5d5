Ride-hailing service, Taxify, says it is expanding its South African operations to include four key coastal towns ahead of the peak holiday season. The launch will see Taxify roll-out to Plettenberg Bay, Knysna, George and Mossel Bay in late November. This announcement continues Taxify’s recent aggressive local expansion, following launches in East London, Polokwane and Pietermaritzburg over the last two months. The ride-hailing service said in June 2018 that it had completed an investment round of $175 million, and that it intended to use this investment to expand its services worldwide – particularly across Africa. “Adding these four new towns to our South African network emphasizes our continued focus on launching ride-hailing services in more towns and cities across the country, outside of the obvious main centres,” said Gareth Taylor, country manager for Taxify in South Africa. He added that Taxify will now operate in 13 cities and towns across five provinces, and is available in more urban centres than any other ride-hailing platform. At an international level, South Africa will have more Taxify-serviced cities and towns than any other country in its global network. “We intend to expand our footprint even further during 2019, as we believe that all South Africans can benefit from the convenience and cost-efficiency of ride-hailing,” said Taylor. As of December 2018, Taxify locations will now include Johannesburg, Tshwane, Ekurhuleni, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Polokwane, East London, Pietermaritzburg, Plettenburg Bay, Knysna, George and Mossel Bay.
