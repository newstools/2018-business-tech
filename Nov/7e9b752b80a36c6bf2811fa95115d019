South Africa’s city centres are the biggest crime hot spots across the country, according to crime data. Crimestatssa.com has broken down the latest SAPS crimes stats for 2018 regionally, to show which areas across South Africa’s nine provinces had the most reported crimes between April 2017 and March 2018. In South Africa, crimes need to be reported at the police station that is closest to where the crime took place, giving a fair indication of the crime levels in the general region the police station is found in. It should be noted, however, that station statistics may encompass more areas than where the station is located. For example, a station in a remote area may represent the reported crimes of several neighbourhoods and small towns surrounding it, as it is the only station available to service those areas. There are approximately 1,140 police stations in the country. Crime levels are often tied to population numbers, thus is comes as no surprise that Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal rank as the three provinces worst-affected by crime. These provinces are home the three most populous metro areas in the country – and across all three provinces, the city centres had the most reported crimes. While Gauteng has the highest number of crimes, the worst precincts are still generally found in the Western Cape.
