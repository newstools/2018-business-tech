Data centre provider Teraco, says that clients using its data centres in Cape Town and Johannesburg will benefit from the cross connection to the South Atlantic Cable System (SACS) – Africa’s first transatlantic link connecting Africa to the Americas. Owned by Angola Cables, the new subsea network provides the most direct routing for internet traffic across the Atlantic and according to Teraco, will bring immense opportunity for clients within the data centre. SACS reduces latency to the Americas substantially, including a reduction from 338ms to 163ms between Cape Town and Miami. The Angola Cables submarine network is already providing Teraco’s data centres in South Africa with direct connectivity to Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Bolivia, but also to Miami giving Teraco’s DC clients a premium opportunity to connect and share digital content with the  America continent. “As Teraco grows its market presence across carrier, content, cloud and enterprise sectors, our clients will benefit from the latency and diversity offered by the subsea cable systems now available. Access to the Americas has never been easier and we look forward to an increase in transatlantic traffic fully utilising the SACS cable system that is built on 100Gig technology,” said Teraco MD, Jan Hnizdo.
