For the first time ever, OneDayOnly.co.za is selling deals at up to 100% off. And how do you plan on doing that, you ask? Like this: No hidden costs. No strings attached. No fine print. Just genuinely good deals at up to 100% off. Deals on OneDayOnly.co.za go live from midnight, but to ensure as many people as possible can secure a 100% off deal for themselves, these particular items will be made available at random times during the day. Shoppers can keep their eyes peeled for big brands like Reebok, Russell Hobbs and Smeg – all with a price tag of R0. While the 100% off products themselves are a closely guarded secret, OneDayOnly.co.za will say this: if there was a hypothetical gun aimed at a hypothetical head and the only way to stop it was to reveal one 100% off deal… well, that deal would be the 40-inch TV. Want to get your hands on the best deals this Black Friday? Be sure to check out OneDayOnly.co.za. This article was published in partnership with OneDayOnly.
