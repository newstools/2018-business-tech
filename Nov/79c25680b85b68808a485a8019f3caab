A panel of expert judges has put a fleet of 39 vehicles under scrutiny as part of the testing phase for the fourth annual Cars.co.za Consumer Awards powered by WesBank. Three finalists in each of the 13 categories were assessed on a wide variety of merits by a total of 20 judges over two days at the Gerotek test facility near Pretoria. The panel comprised Cars.co.za’s in-house team of expert motoring journalists together with a group of hand-picked guest judges, each with a specialist background or field of expertise. All vehicles available on the South African market on September 1, 2018, were eligible, not only new products that were launched in the past 12 months.
