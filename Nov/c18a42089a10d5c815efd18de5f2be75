FNB and eBucks have unveiled their Black Friday specials for 2018 – which will run for two weeks. FNB said that in 2017 it processed an average of over 800,000 card transactions per hour – which peaked at 1.5 million card transactions between 16h00 and 17h00 – during last year’s Black Friday shopping spree. “The transaction volumes give a firm indication that Black Friday has become one of the important days for South African consumers,” said FNB Retail CEO, Raj Makanjee. “Many see this as an opportunity to stretch their budgets amid unrelenting pressure on household income. “Consumers who have set aside a budget will be in a better financial position and we encourage those who need to use credit to do so responsibly. It’s vital for consumers to consider that there’s still a long festive season ahead, therefore, it’s important to reserve some funds for unforeseen emergencies.” Deals FNB’s deals have been running from 19 November, and will run through to the end of the month.
