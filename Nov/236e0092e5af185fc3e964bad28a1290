Twelve vehicles will battle it out for the 2019 AutoTrader South African Car of the Year. The list comprises vehicles from Italy, Japan, Korea, Germany, France and Sweden and, in keeping with the diverse South African automotive landscape, it covers almost every motoring category. George Mienie, AutoTrader CEO, said: “South African motorists have access to vehicles from all over the world and to every conceivable type. This is reflected in the list of finalists.” The list of finalists includes three hatchbacks (the Nissan Micra, Suzuki Swift and Mercedes-Benz A-Class) as well as one hot hatch (the Honda Civic Type R). There is one sedan in the line-up (the Lexus ES), one small 4×4 (the Suzuki Jimny) and one crossover (the Renault Duster). Then, in keeping with the global popularity of sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the balance of the list – the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Hyundai Kona, Mitsubishi Pajero Sport, Porsche Cayenne and Volvo XC40 – is made up of SUVs. The next step will involve testing the finalists by the jury members. Each vehicle will be scored against its direct class competitors on aspects such as exterior and interior design, engine and transmission performance, ride and handling, braking, safety features overall excellence and affordability. The results will be made known in early April 2019.
