Indeed, one of the largest online retailers, Takealot.com, reported Sunday (25 November), that it generated record sales this past Black Friday. It said that thousands of shoppers took to the site with 68% choosing to shop from their mobile phones. Within the first hour, R11.5 million in GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) was generated and by 08:30 the retailer surpassed its entire Black Friday 2017 GMV, it said. The total transaction value for Black Friday 2018 on Takealot.com amounted to over R196 million – a 125% year-on-year growth in GMV and 127% growth in orders.
