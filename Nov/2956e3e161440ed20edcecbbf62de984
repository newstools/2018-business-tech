Frogfoot Networks, an open access fibre network provider and subsidiary of Vox, says it is on track to bring fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) to an additional 14,000 homes in the Southern Peninsula, Western Cape by April 2019. “In 2016 we embarked on an aggressive FTTH expansion programme and we have already passed over 30,000 homes to date of which 20,000 are in the Western Cape,” said Shane Chorley, head of sales at Frogfoot. The additional rollout over the next five months will take place in Fish Hoek, Capri, Glencairn, Kommetjie, Lakeside, Muizenberg, Noordhoek, San Michel, Simon’s Town, Sun Valley and Sunnydale. “There is an insatiable demand for fibre and we only see this trend accelerating. This technology shift from ADSL to fibre is similar to the transition from fixed telephone lines to mobile phones. As technology advances are made, and new solutions that will change lives become available, consumer adoption follows,” Chorley said. High speed, reliable connectivity is shifting traditional content consumption habits, which includes video-on-demand services such as Netflix and Showmax. “As a result of this growing demand for seamless connectivity, we see significant growth potential in the FTTH sector. Our commitment is to connect 150,000 homes nationally by the end of 2019,” Chorley said. See if your area is part of the Frogfoot FTTH network, here.
