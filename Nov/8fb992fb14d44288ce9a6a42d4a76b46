While boomed areas may be a common sight in large parts of the country, Durban’s municipal by-laws currently prohibit their installation. The by-laws state that no person is allowed to place any obstruction on a public road, and the city has previously removed illegal boom gates in some communities. According to a report by the Sunday Tribune, this was set to change after a motion was brought by Durban North ward councillor, Shaun Ryley. In the motion, the DA requested the committee to investigate and consider drafting an official policy on privately funded security measures in neighbourhoods. This would include installation of security huts, boom gates and security guards conducting streets patrols in compliance with the constitution. However, the report noted that most members of the council voted against the motion, with no reasons provided for the opposition. Riley said that this was despite the fact that a large number of residents were willing to put their own money into these security features. Ryley said that as violent crime escalated across the country, many communities within eThekwini were constantly looking for ways to strengthen safety and security in their neighbourhoods at their own expense. “Such measures have the potential to supplement the efforts of SAPS and metro police in fulfilling their crime prevention responsibilities. “However, confusion exists around what is permissible and what is not due to the lack of a codified policy or by-law,” he said.
