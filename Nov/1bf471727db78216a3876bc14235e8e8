President Cyril Ramaphosa has combined two government departments and appointed new ministers in a cabinet reshuffle. At a media briefing at the Union Buildings on Thursday (22 November), Ramaphosa announced that the Department of Communications and the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services will be combined into a single ministry, with Stella Ndabeni Abrahams at the helm. Meanwhile, former telco minister Siyabonga Cwele will take over as minister of Home Affairs, and Nomvula Mokonyane as minister of Environmental Affairs. The changes were made to fill the positions left vacant by Malusi Gigaba and Edna Molewa. Former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba stepped down from the position and resigned as a member of Parliament following his implication in state capture at Eskom, while also being found by the High Court as have lied under oath. Environmental Affairs minister Edna Molewa, passed away in September after a short illness while on an official trip to China. Thursday’s reshuffle sets the precedent for how Ramaphosa aims to structure his cabinet in the future. According to the president, after the 2019 national elections, there will be a much larger review of government, which will follow the same style as the combination of departments announced. Government sources have told Bloomberg that Ramaphosa may  ultimately create a ‘super-ministry’ for economic policy as part of an overhaul of the nation’s executive. Citing three people familiar with the matter, the media group said that he new ministry will likely combine various economic departments, including the National Treasury, to simplify policy formulation and avoid the duplication of roles.
