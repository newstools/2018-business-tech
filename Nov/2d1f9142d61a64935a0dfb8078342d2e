President Cyril Ramaphosa will be signing off on a new national minimum wage for South Africa today, according to unions. Originally expected to be introduced from 1 May, the presidency announced last week that the new minimum wage was part of eight bills that Ramaphosa was set to sign into law. The National Minimum Wage Bill will set the new minimum wage at R20 for each ordinary hour worked. Farm workers, domestic workers, learners employed in terms of the Skills Development Act and workers on expanded public works programmes have different minimum hourly rates which will apply from a date to be fixed by the President. An exemption may only be granted if the employer cannot afford to pay the minimum wage and after meaningful consultation with every trade union representing affected employees or the affected employee him/herself in absence of a trade union. Ramaphosa is also expected to be signing amendments to the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the Labour Relations Amendment Act, which largely cater for the National Minimum Wage Bill. The “imminent” signing of the bill was welcomed by unions, which have been campaigning for and putting pressure on Ramaphosa to put the bills into law. The Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers’ Union (SACTWU) said that the signing of the bill will change the lives of between 4 and 6 million South African workers and their families. “Although this wage is not yet a living wage, its positive impact will still help many millions of workers to better look after their families,” the union said. “By increasing their buying power, the NMW will also drive demand and stimulate the economy. This must be welcomed. “Nevertheless we will continue to fight for a living wage for our members, using this NMW as a platform,” it said.
