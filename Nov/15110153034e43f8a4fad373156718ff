The company said this will include including the new Learn with Facebook career development site, an enhanced Mentorship tool, and an improved Jobs on Facebook product. The launch of these resources falls in line with Facebook’s commitment to training business owners across Africa and equipping people with the skills they need to thrive in the modern digital workplace, it said. You can find a breakdown of each of the new tools below: Learn with Facebook provides an introduction to the hard and soft skills people need to advance in today’s digital workforce. Learn with Facebook’s lessons include “Ace Your Interview” and “Manage Your Content Marketing” and are free to access. They feature case studies, insider tips and resources from industry experts. In 2017 Facebook launched Jobs on Facebook and to date, the jobs product has helped people find over 1 million jobs. Now, in addition to posting jobs to their Page, businesses can now share their jobs in Groups. Today, more than 200 million people on Facebook are members of Groups they consider meaningful, and this update will allow people who may be interested and qualified to better discover open roles. The Mentorship tool connects people in Groups who are seeking mentorship with others in their community who have relevant experience or expertise. Now, Facebook is making it easier for people in Groups to choose a mentorship partner based on their goals and interests.
People can sign up to share information about what they’re offering or looking for, and then others in the Group can browse a list of those available people to find a match and reach out directly. Each week the tool gives pairs helpful prompts to keep the conversation going. Read: You could soon face jail time for sending these 3 types of Facebook or WhatsApp messages in South Africa
