Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: A leaked submission by Pravin Gordhan to the Zondo commission shows the extent of the minister’s involvement with the Guptas.

[EWN] President Jacob Zuma cost South Africa R500 billion when he fired Nhlabhla Nene as finance minister in late 2015.

[702] An investigation into the 2014 collapse of African Bank has found that professional services group Deloitte knew of the bank’s dodgy practices at least 4 years before it led to the collapse – and did nothing to prevent it. African Bank was overstating the size of its loan book while understating impairment charges by billions. [Business Day] MTN is said to be getting close to a deal with Nigeria’s central bank over the $8.1 billion the bank claims is owed to it. A settlement is expected to be announced by Monday, with a possibility it could come as early as today.

On Friday the rand was at R14.18 to the dollar, R18.51 to the pound and R16.10 to the euro.
