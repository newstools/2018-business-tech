The latest crash test results released by Global NCAP and  Automobile Association  South Africa show that Nissan’s NP300 ‘Hardbody’ received a zero-star safety rating. The vehicle structure collapsed and was found to be unstable during the test. The AA added that the NP300’s bodyshell was so unstable that its airbags were ineffective, and the high forces placed on the crash test driver dummy pose a significant risk of fatal injury. Global NCAP secretary general, David Ward, and AA South Africa CEO, Collins Khumalo, have now written to the UN Economic Commission for Africa and the African Development Bank, calling for urgent action by African governments to prevent the sale of zero star cars like the Nissan NP300. “The zero star result of the NP300 is particularly troubling as the car is fitted with dual airbags and this might encourage consumers to believe that the car has a good level of safety,” David Ward, Global NCAP secretary-general said. “Indeed, Nissan misleadingly claims that the car occupants are protected by a so-called ‘Safety Shield’ and its ‘Hardbody’ label also conveys an image of strength. “However, in our crash test, the car’s bodyshell collapsed and neither the steering column nor the airbags acted as they should to minimise the risk of injury.” “In our view remedial action to strengthen the NP300’s bodyshell is now urgently needed. This is a concern not just in South Africa but elsewhere as Nissan has plans to increase exports of this vehicle across Africa.” Watch: bakkie scores zero in South African crash safety test
