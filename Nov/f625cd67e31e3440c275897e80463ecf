South Africa’s private and public schools have set their fees for 2019. According to a report by the Sunday Times the increases are set for well above inflation, with schools also expecting a rise in applications for fee exemptions from cash-strapped parents. A survey of twenty schools taken by the paper showed increases at state schools averaged 8.2% and hikes at private schools were on average 7.8% – significantly higher than the current 4.9% inflation rate. Commenting on the increases, economist Azar Jammine, said that private schools are becoming the ambit of the corporate elite and that more people are no longer finding it affordable. He added that many ordinary professionals are now struggling to keep pace with some of the private school fees, which is expected to lead to an increase in admissions to former Model C schools. Fee exemptions While higher-income parents are feeling the pinch, a record number of parents are expected to apply for fee exemptions next year. According to the survey, Parktown High School for Girls in Johannesburg – which  was awarded R5.8 million in fee exemptions this year – has earmarked R5.9 million for next year to assist 15% to 20% of the total pupil population. Other schools also indicated that there were a growing number of parents who simply could not afford to pay for school fees. Headmaster of Hoërskool Pietersburg, Willie Schoeman, said that parents of 93 pupils at his school still owed R1.8 million in fees for this year. “The number of people applying for school fee exemptions will grow,” he said. “We try and push battling parents to pay something, even if it’s R200 a month”.
