Organisers of the Telkom 947 Cycle Challenge have urged motorists to take note of wide-ranging road closures ahead of Johannesburg’s biggest cycling race on Sunday, 18 November. This year’s route has been flipped, meaning the previous year’s start will now be the finish line and vice-versa. This is expected to have a significant impact on Joburg’s roads between 04h00 and 15h00, and the City of Johannesburg has advised motorists to use alternative routes during the affected times to travel to their destinations. The annual ride will start and finish at the Riversands Commercial Park just off the R511 in Fourways. It will continue through the streets of Joburg from Steyn City Boulevard through to Cedar Road, via Witkoppen Road, up through Jan Smuts Avenue until the M1 South and back. Cyclists will ride home through the R55, via Summit Road and back up to the finish line along Riversands Boulevard. To ensure the safety of all cyclists, the city has also ratified the closure of arterial roads, including the M1, Jan Smuts Avenue and several other routes in the Inner City. Closed routes will be manned by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) and no access will be granted during the bicycle ride.
