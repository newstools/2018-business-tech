Power utility Eskom has announced that stage two load shedding will be in effect on Friday (30 November) between 09h00 and 22h00 as a result of loss of additional units overnight. “Stage 2 calls for 2,000MW to rotationally load shed nationally at a given period. Loadshedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout,” Eskom said. “We encourage residents and businesses to please use electricity sparingly to ease the demand of electricity. Please switch off geysers during the day as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand.” “Customers are advised to keep checking their load shedding schedules on the Eskom or municipal website, and plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place.” The group said it would provide updates on the status of the power system through various media platforms.
