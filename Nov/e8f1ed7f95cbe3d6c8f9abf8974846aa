The past year has seen an increase in the number of home robberies, with an estimated 156,089 incidents of home robberies being recorded according to the latest Victims of Crime Survey. This effectively amounts to a 3% year-on-year increase compared to 2017. Security company, Fidelity ADT, said that it is important that residents try to stay calm in these situations, and to try and think rationally. “Unless you feel you are facing an imminent life-and-death situation, don’t fight back,” it said. “As hard as it may be, accept your situation and give your assailants time to take any material possessions they want. Speak only if spoken to and then try to keep your answers short and to the point. “Be conscious not to stare at the assailants but try nevertheless to get a good look at them and memorise their physical details and clothing. Listen for any names or other details that might help identify them later.” Fidelity ADT said that the first few minutes of a home invasion are typically the most dangerous. It added that during these moments it was important to try and remain calm and quiet. “If you are not threatening, the assailants can concentrate on their goals and leave,” it said. “We strongly advise that residents speak to their families and staff about possible scenarios so they can be aware of what to do should they ever find themselves confronted with a home invasion.” Read: The 10 worst crime areas in every province in South Africa
