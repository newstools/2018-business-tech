Ahead of its big Black Friday 2018 sale on the 23rd of November, Game has released a list of stores which will be opening at midnight. While Black Friday has typically been seen as an American ‘holiday’, it has quickly become South Africa’s most important shopping day of the year (alongside Cyber Monday). Speaking to MyBroadband in October, Game said that a number of its stores would be opening several hours earlier than normal – some as early as midnight on 22 November – to accommodate the rush. It added that it plans to offer ‘phenomenal specials’ in every merchandise category at all its 145 stores in South Africa and Africa on the day.
