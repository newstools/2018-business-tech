Discovery has published new pricing schedules for its medical aid plans for 2019. The insurance provider announced its 2019 changes in September, saying that its prices would increase by a weighted 9.2% across its plans. Discovery Health Medical Scheme is the largest open medical scheme in South Africa, covering nearly 2.8 million beneficiaries at 31 December 2017, and with an open medical scheme market share of approximately 56%. According to Discovery, it estimates total medical inflation for 2018 at between 11.2% and 12.2%, with the variance due to utilisation trends in different health plan options. “However, risk management by Discovery Health and the ongoing positive impact of the Vitality wellness programme on members’ health, will reduce medical inflation by 2%, resulting in contribution increases that are within the corridor of 3% to 4% above CPI after allowing for the required adjustment for VAT,” it said. With CPI sitting at 5.1% in July, a CPI + 4% increase puts the industry range at 9.1%. For a full description of the Discovery policy and benefit updates for 2019, you can read the changes here.
