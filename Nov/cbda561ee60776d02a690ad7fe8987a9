A new heliport is under construction in Waterfall City in Midrand – the first privately-owned purpose-built helicopter port in the country. The project was first announced in 2016, when the build cost was estimated at R60 million, being developed in partnership between Ultimate Aviation and the National Airways Corporation (NAC). The Department of Transport granted the heliport licence in August 2018.  According to the NAC, the heliport is being developed in two phases – the first phase on 32 hectares of land comprises 3,100 square meters of hangars, 2,800 square meters of office space, including a terminal building, VIP lounge facilities, a restaurant, fuel farm, EASA standard FATO (final approach and take off area) and parking pads for up to sixteen helicopters. Phase two is expected to add more hangar space and more office space as is needed. “The state-of-the-art facility, which will be used primarily for helicopter operations, maintenance and pilot training, is in an ideal location close to Johannesburg, Sandton, Centurion and Pretoria,” said NAC CEO, Martin Banner. “Centralising our Helicopter Operations and Pilot Training Schools from Grand Central and Rand Airport to our own dedicated helicopter facility will allow the company to continue to grow and offer an even better and more convenient service to our helicopter owners, pilots and charter clients.” NAC is South Africa’s leading and largest helicopter operator offering helicopter sales, helicopter charter, scenic helicopter flights, helicopter contracts and specialised operations, helicopter management, helicopter maintenance and pilot training. The heliport is set to open at the end of November 2018. Read: A look at the new R1.2 billion high-rise luxury apartments in Waterfall City
