Power utility Eskom has announced that stage one load shedding will be in effect on Thursday (29 November) between 12h00 and 22h00. “As a result of increased generation plant being out for planned maintenance and unplanned outages, stage one load shedding will be implemented,” it said. “Customers are advised to keep checking their load shedding schedules on the Eskom website or municipal websites to determine when they are due to get load shedding.” Stage one load shedding allows for 1000MW to be shed nation wide. It is a last measure resort to protect the power system from total collapse or complete blackout. “We encourage residents and businesses to please use electricity sparingly to ease the demand. Please switch off geysers as well as non-essential lighting and electricity applications to assist in reducing demand.” The group said it would provide updates on the status of the power system through various media platforms.
