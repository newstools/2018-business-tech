If you’re working up an appetite chasing Black Friday deals, several fast food chains have you covered. Pizza Hut, Domino’s and Starbucks are running some one-day-only specials on food and drinks – with Steers and Debonairs joining the craze for Cyber Monday.

Domino’s  Domino’s Pizza is running a special for pizzas at R59.90. The deal applies to large traditional and famous pizzas.
