Microsoft South Africa has launched Head Start – an end-to-end program built to help tech startups grow. The support program will boost tech startups by giving them open access to wide-ranging skills development resources, coaches and mentors, a fully-fledged customer network, and the platform on which to build their products and services. Microsoft added that Head Start is a complete program that will help tech startups innovate in the most trusted cloud – Azure – while strengthening the local startup system and preparing them to sell to global marketplace. “As a company whose mission it is to empower every person and organisation on the planet to achieve more, we get how critical entrepreneurship is, especially in the South African context where job creation is vital if we are to improve our economy,” said Lionel Moyal, commercial partners lead at Microsoft South Africa. He added that the business benefits for tech startups are multiple and immediate. “When candidates join the Microsoft Partner Network, they instantly become part of a global community that connects them to the relationships, insights, tools, resources, and programs needed to amaze customers and drive growth.” Moyal said that through Head Start, Microsoft South Africa can help grow tech startup businesses by opening the right doors at every stage of the journey. “By connecting tech startups with a worldwide network of customers, cloud architects, business development experts, and the latest cloud technologies, Microsoft wants to nurture and evolve these startups into fully-fledged Microsoft partners themselves,” he said “The ecosystem itself is far bigger than Microsoft, but by backing the bold entrepreneurial spirit of the brave tech startup, we can bring real change to the future of the country and the continent,” said Moyal.
