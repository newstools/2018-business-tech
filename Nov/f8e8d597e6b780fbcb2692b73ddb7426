Retailer Game has announced its warm-up deals for Black Friday 2018. The deals which will run from 14 – 23 November are aimed at giving customers a taste of some of the deals they can expect in South Africa’s retailing week of the year. While Black Friday has typically been seen as an American ‘holiday’, it has quickly become South Africa’s most important shopping day of the year – alongside Cyber Monday. Game said that a number of its stores would be opening several hours earlier than normal – some as early as midnight on 22 November – to accommodate the rush. It added that it plans to offer ‘phenomenal specials’ in every merchandise category at all its 145 stores in South Africa and Africa on the day. Speaking to MyBroadband, Massdiscounters MD Albert Voogd said that Game will have unbeatable deals on offer in store and online on Black Friday. “We have gone the extra mile to source unbeatable deals that offer huge savings for our customers. Our customers should watch for many more exciting offers from Game over the course of next week, leading up to Black Friday.” You can find the full list of the warm-up deals here.
