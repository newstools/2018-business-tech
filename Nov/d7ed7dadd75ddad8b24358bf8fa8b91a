Takealot has confirmed that its Blue Dot Sale will go live at 00:01 on Friday morning, 23 November. The sale will run over the entire Black Friday weekend (including Cyber Monday) – ending on Tuesday, 27 November. The online retailer said that more than 10,000 deals will be available over this time period, with up to 60% off, however, it cautioned that stock would be limited. It has also encouraged customers to sign up for its newsletter service to be among the first to receive a notification about its deals. “Takealot will be offering amazing discounts on thousands of products over a five-day period,” said Julie-Anne Walsh, chief marketing officer of Takealot. “Customers can expect discounts on everything from cellphones and laptops, to TVs, kitchen appliances, beauty ranges, toys, baby products, gaming, liquor and much more.” Extensive preparations As the biggest online retailer in South Africa, Black Friday is seen as a massive day for Takealot with more than R87 million in gross merchandising value in 2017. Speaking to MyBroadband, Takealot CEO Kim Reid said that he expects this to grow by 2.2-times in 2018. However, this popularity also comes with downsides, with last year’s Black Friday marred by large periods of downtime as Takealot’s website battled to cope with the heavy traffic. Reid acknowledged these issues and stated that Takealot has done extensive testing in preparation for Black Friday 2018, and will do its best to serve all customers. “Indications are good we can handle volume over Black Friday,” he said. However, Reid said they cannot directly answer the question: “Will Takealot stay up on Black Friday 2018?” “We must be brutally honest about this,” said Reid, adding that Takealot has gone down multiple times on Black Friday in recent years. “We will see on the 23rd.” Read: How to shop on Black Friday 2018 like a financial pro
