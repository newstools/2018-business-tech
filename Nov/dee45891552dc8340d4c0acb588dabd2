Momentum Health has published its fee schedule for 2019, showing how much clients can expect to pay for their various schemes in 2019. According to the group, the average increase in contributions across its plans is 10.7% –  slightly above the industry corridor of 3% to 4% above CPI. The group cited rising medical inflation and the April 2018 VAT hike to 15% as reason for the increase. “The healthcare industry in South Africa is constant flux, perhaps more so at present than in recent years, given an increasingly unstable economic landscape and the proposal of new NHI regulations,” it said. Despite the increase, Momentum said it still has one of the lowest average contributions on the market and has also avoided having to reduce benefits to achieve lower prices. Momentum is the fourth biggest private medical aid scheme in South Africa with over 260,000 beneficiaries, behind Discovery, Bonitas and PolMed (fifth, if you include the government medical scheme, GEMS).
