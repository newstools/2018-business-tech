Netflix has been named as the simplest, most easily understood and used service in the world, in a new survey, by Siegel+Gale. “The 2018 top-ranked companies consistently deliver on their brand promise with simple, clear, intuitive experiences, the report said. “Its ease of experience, which allows users to stream, pause and resume viewing high-quality content—without commercials or commitments—earns them the top honor for simplicity,” the survey said of Netflix. Siegel+Gale asked more than 15,000 people across nine countries in the US, Europe, Asia, India, and the Middle East to evaluate brands and industries on their simplicity. It found that 55% of people are willing to pay more for simpler experiences, while nearly two thirds of respondents are more likely to recommend a brand that delivers simple experiences. Companies that fail to provide simple experiences lose out on billions collectively. “World’s Simplest Brands quantifies the substantial monetary value of investing in simplifying,” said Howard Belk, co-CEO and chief creative officer, Siegel+Gale. “Now in its eighth year, our study reaffirms an increasing demand for transparent, direct, simple experiences that make peoples’ lives easier. Once again the data proves that simplicity pays.” Top 10 World’s Simplest Brands: Netflix
