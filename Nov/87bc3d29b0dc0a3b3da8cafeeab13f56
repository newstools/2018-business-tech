MTN has launched Black Friday deals specifically for business. From 23 to 26 November 2018, entrepreneurs have access to a range of MTN Made For Business SIM-only deals, where devices can be added at a reduced cost. “Black Friday is another platform to deliver a bold new digital world to our customers at lower prices, providing more value for less. We saw Black Friday as an opportunity to be innovative in packaging our deals and offer tailored solutions to customers,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, executive: corporate affairs at MTN South Africa. “This extends beyond consumer deals. It is essential to look at supporting small businesses wherever we can. Ultimately, the SME sector is the driver of our economy, and we need to help them keep their operating costs down so that they can focus on running their businesses and making money.” Prices are per month for 12 months on MTN Made For Business S for SIM only deals, and per month for 24 months when you buy a Mega SIM-Only Deal for devices and LTE.
