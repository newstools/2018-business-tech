Asset manager at Vestact, Bright Khumalo, has published a list of the 10 biggest winners and 10 biggest losers on the JSE so far in 2018 – showing which listed companies have seen their share prices blow up, and which saw their market prices crash. The investor showed the rankings of both the All Share Index as well as the Top 40 Index, led by Mix Telematics and Anglo American, respectively. While the All Share has delivered a return of -8.77% year-to-date, Mix and a group of other companies bucked the trend by some margin. Mix showed a positive price return of 51.75%, just ahead of Montauk Energy Solutions which showed a return of 51.39%. On the Top 40 Index, the overall index showed a similar negative return as the All Share, with -8.73%. Anglo American has led the index with a positive price return of 25.17%, followed by other mining firms BHP Billiton and Anglo Gold Ashanti with a return of 19.51% and 14.22%, respectively. Among the worst-perming companies, the All Share had Fortress REIT in bottom position (-64.05%), just below Blue Label Telecom (-63.81%). Blue Label in particular had a challenging year after shareholders punished the group for Cell C’s less than stellar results – however, it was Tiger Brands on the Top 40 Index that took the biggest hit following the widely publicised listeria outbreak, which many held the group responsible for. Tiger Brands posted a YTD negative return of -40.66%, below Aspen Pharmacare (-38.74%). Telco group MTN also featured on the worst-performing list with a negative return of -36.35% YTD. MTN has been hammered over the past few years because of regulatory issues in Nigeria. Most recently, the group was accused of expatriating money to shareholders by Nigeria’s Central Bank, which has demanded that $8.1 billion be returned to the country.
