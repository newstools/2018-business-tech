Market research firm Ipsos has released its Vehicle Quality Survey (VQS) for 2018. The VQS was conducted throughout South Africa in 2017, involving survey feedback from 7,000 owners of vehicles from 16 brands. The survey calculates a quality score based on customer’s feedback at about three months after they’ve purchased the vehicle. Scores reflect proportions of problems and issues reported by these customers and so the lower the score the better the quality. According to the results, Toyota achieved 13 gold awards – seven for passenger cars and six for  light commercial vehicles (LCVs) – from 16 categories. Volkswagen was runner-up with eight golds in 2017 after collecting four in the 2016 survey. Other gold award winners in 2017, (with the 2016 score in parentheses) include: Audi, 5 (5); Isuzu, 3 (0); Honda, 3 (0); Nissan, 2 (8); Opel, 2 (1); and Ford, 2 (2). More than one gold award was awarded in some of the categories where two or more vehicles or manufacturers qualified by achieving the same scores.
