The Ford EcoSport enjoys prominence on the sales charts in the compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment, having  announced facelift for this model in June. The motoring group has introduced a new entry-level petrol-powered model in the form of the 1.5 Ti-VCT Ambiente. The 1.5 Ti-VCT Ambiente is the most affordable offering, followed by the 1.5 TDCi Ambiente which shares an identical level of standard specification, along with the five-speed manual gearbox. Powering the new addition to the EcoSport range is a 1.5-litre Ti-VCT three-cylinder petrol engine that recently made its debut in the refreshed Ford Figo line-up. It also relies on twin independent variable camshaft timing (Ti-VCT) for the four-valves-per-cylinder engine to deliver improved low-down torque as well as top-end power. The fitment of a dual-stage variable oil pump further enhances efficiency, while reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The 1.5 Ti-VCT engine is credited with a maximum power output of 92kW and peak torque of 170Nm, Ford said. “Despite the new EcoSport 1.5 Ambiente being positioned as the entry-level model in the range, it is equipped with an outstanding level of standard features,” it said. The safety package incorporates Electronic Stability Control, six airbags, ISOFIX child seat mounting points, rear parking sensors and manually activated ‘Follow-me-home’ headlamps. Electric windows are fitted all round, along with remote central locking, a perimeter alarm, power heated side mirrors, air-conditioning and a towbar prep pack that enables easy dealer fitment of the optional towbar.
