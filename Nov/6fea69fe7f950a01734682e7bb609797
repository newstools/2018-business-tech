Despite recent calls by the ANC to scrap e-tolls in Gauteng, the controversial system is not going anywhere. This is according to Electronic Toll Collection chief executive, Coenie Vermaak who was speaking to eNCA on Thursday (1 November). Vermaak said that finance minister Tito Mboweni backed the user-pay principle in his mid-term budget speech – which prompting a protest to the to the Union Buildings by Cosatu. However, he noted that a large number of the trade union’s constituents are actually exempt from tax, from e-tolls, because they use public transport more often than not, and as a result, the poor people of South Africa are not suffering because of these toll roads. Vermaak added that the Gauteng ANC and other political parties were adding fuel to the fire by calling for the removal of the tolls. “When the government makes these statements or Mr Makhura, makes a statement to say they want it scrapped, it does hurt us because we can definitely see a drop in revenue. Then we have to start all over, reconfigure, assist people. I think sometimes we’re our own worst enemy.” “The reality is in the end after we’ve had our elections, we will still be here and we’ll still need to fix this problem. So my comment to political parties will be that it’s great to complain, but let’s find some solutions,” Vermaak said. Read: E-tolls must be scrapped, says ANC
