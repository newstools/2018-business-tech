Pick n Pay Hypermarket has launched its Black Friday 2018 deals. Pick n Pay said that customers can expect up to 60% off various items including fridges, televisions, appliances and pool products. “We promised our customers our biggest Black Friday ever. We’ve worked closely with our suppliers to negotiate lower prices and extra stock so that we can offer our customers the best deals over a few days and not just Black Friday,” said John Bradshaw, head of marketing at Pick n Pay. “We also wanted to do something different for our customers this year so that everyone can maximise their savings without having to tackle the store on Black Friday – one of our busiest trading days.” Bradshaw further encouraged customers to get in-store early to avoid disappointment as some deals have limited units available. Pick n Pay has also limited some of the deals to a specific number per customer to ensure more customers enjoy them. On actual Black Friday – 23 November – more deals will launch across all Pick n Pay stores, including Hypermarkets. All stores will open at 06h59 on Black Friday, and these deals will run over a three-day period until 25 November 2018. Pick n Pay’s online shop – which has been running weekly deals since 5 November – will launch its three-day Black Friday deals at 00h01 on the 23 November 2018 and will have selected online-only deals.
