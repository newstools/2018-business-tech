Following his resignation as home affairs minister, Malusi Gigaba has now stepped down as a member of parliament. Gigaba handed in his letter of resignation to speaker Baleka Mbete on Thursday morning, meaning that he cannot be sanctioned by Parliament for lying under oath. The presidency confirmed on Tuesday (13 November) that Gigaba had resigned as home affairs minister, saying that he was stepping down from his position “for the good of the country”. He added that the move was to relieve president Cyril Ramaphosa of “undue pressure” and to allow him to focus on improving the lives of South Africans. Gigaba’s had to face two parliamentary inquiries into state capture, was found to have lied under oath by a High Court and to have violated the ethics code for MPs by the Public Protector. The Constitutional Court dismissed his application to appeal the High Court ruling, effectively upholding the findings. According to EWN, having now resigned as MP, Gigaba can’t be taken to task by parliament for lying under oath. Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo told the group that with the resignation of the former minister as a Member of Parliament, the Ethics Committee will have to make its own decision on the matter. Gigaba remains a member of the ANC’s National Executive Committee. Read: Gigaba resigns as home affairs minister
