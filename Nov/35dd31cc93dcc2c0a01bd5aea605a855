Home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba has resigned. The presidency confirmed on Tuesday (13 November) that Gigaba handed in his resignation letter, in which he said that he was stepping down from his position “for the good of the country”. He added that the move was to relieve president Cyril Ramaphosa of “undue pressure” and to allow him to focus on improving the lives of South Africans. Speculation emerged at the start of the week suggesting that Gigaba may get the chop. Pressure has been mounting on the minister to resign after he was heavily implicated in scandals at Eskom, while it was effectively upheld by the Constitutional Court that he had lied under oath during court proceedings around the Fireblade terminal at OR Tambo International. Gigaba was also blamed for massive damage done to the tourism industry through controversial visa rules, which analysts said, cost the country billions. The presidency said that transport minister Blade Nzimande will be acting as minister of home affairs until a permanent appointment is made. Read: Gigaba lied under oath: Public Protector
