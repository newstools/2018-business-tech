Makro has launched its Black Friday 2018 sale, with as many as 26,000 deals on various products. The Makro Black 5-Day sale runs from Wednesday 21 November and ends on Sunday 25 November. Shopping hours will be extended as follows: Wednesday to Friday – 08:00 to 18:00
Saturday – 08:00 to 16:00
Sunday – 09:00 to 16:00 To ensure that it delivers on its promises over Black 5 Day, Makro said its online site will be functioning a little differently to normal. When shopping online over this period (21-25 November), you will only be able to buy Black 5 Day sale items. The group has partnered with ride hailing app, Uber. “Grab an Uber on us! This Black 5 Day, Makro is giving you two R50 Uber vouchers to get you to our sale and back home again (Ts & Cs apply).” “For five days only, Makro is giving all mCard users 10% discount off all purchases made in a Makro store, as long as these are non-Black 5 Day-marked promotional items,” it said. Over Black 5 Day, all deliveries will cost just R70, Makro said. This includes orders made both online and in-store. If you opted for a locker delivery or to click-and-collect your order, then your delivery is free. You can find out more about locker deliveries here.
