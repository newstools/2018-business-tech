Volkswagen has unveiled its Tarok Concept bakkie at the São Paulo International Motor Show. The Tarok is powered by a 1.4-litre 110 kW / 150 PS four-cylinder TSI engine, which can be driven as a TotalFlex Fuel Unit both with pure ethanol (E100) as well as a gasoline-ethanol blend (E22). The TSI engine has been combined with a 6-speed automatic gearbox and permanent 4MOTION all-wheel drive. The interior also indicates a new way forward for VW in the pick-up segment, with a primarily digital design, “Eye-catching elements include a colour-keyed crossbar in Cypress Metallic that stretches across the entire dash panel,” Volkswagen said. “This crossbar surrounds a glass-covered Infotainment system, digital air conditioning controls and a Digital Cockpit, which together form the main cockpit elements with all displays and controls on a single visual and operational axis.” The Tarok will also include a large variable loading area, which can be extended thanks to the folding rear panel in the spacious four-door double cab. While the vehicle shows at the motor show is only a concept, Volkswagen confirmed that it would plans to release a series version of the Tarok Concept on the market in Brazil, with barely any changes. “The avant-garde pick-up also has the potential to boost Volkswagen’s model range in other global markets,” it said. “The future series model will start out with a 2.0-litre turbo diesel direct injection (TDI) TSI engine that also delivers 110 kW / 150 PS.”     Read: Mercedes shows off new X² bakkie
